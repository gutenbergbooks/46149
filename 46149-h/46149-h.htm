<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The aim of this book is to provide, within a short
space, and primarily for the general reader, an account
of the heresies of the Middle Ages and of the attitude of
the Church towards them. The book is, therefore, a brief
essay in the history not only of dogma, but, inasmuch
as it is concerned with the repression of heresy by means
of the Inquisition, of judicature also. The ground
covered is the <i>terrain</i> of H. C. Lea’s immense work,
‘A History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages’; but
that was published more than thirty years ago, and since
then much has been written, though not indeed much
in English, on the mediæval Inquisition and cognate
subjects. As the present work has been undertaken
in the light of some of these more recent investigations,
it is hoped that it may be of utility to rather closer
students, as well as to the general reader, as a review of
the subject suggested by the writings of Lea’s successors,
both partizans and critics. At the same time this book
does not profess to be a history, even the briefest, of
the mediæval Inquisition. Its main concern is with
doctrine, and for that reason chapters on Averrhoïsm
and on Wyclifitism and Husitism have been included,
though they have little bearing on the Inquisition.</p>

<p>The entire subject, on both its sides, is complex and
highly controversial. Probably no conceivable treatment
of it could commend itself to all tastes, be accepted
as impartial by the adherents of all types of religious
belief. It can, however, at least be claimed that this
work was begun with no other object in view than honest
enquiry, with no desire whatever to demonstrate a
preconceived thesis or draw attention to a particular
aspect of truth. The conclusion arrived at in these
pages is, that the traditional ultra-Protestant conception
<span class="pagenum">[vi]</span>of ecclesiastical intolerance forcing a policy of persecution
on an unwilling or indifferent laity in the Middle Ages
is unhistorical, while, on the other hand, some recent
Catholic apologists, in seeking to exculpate the Church,
have tended to underestimate the power and influence
of the Church, and to read into the Middle Ages a humanitarianism
which did not actually then exist. Heresy
was persecuted because it was regarded as dangerous
to society, and intolerance was therefore the reflection,
not only of the ecclesiastical authority, but of public
opinion. On the other hand, clerical instruction had a
large formative influence in the creation of public opinion.</p>

<p>This book inevitably suffered a prolonged interruption
owing to the War. That there was not a
complete cessation at once I owe to my Father, who
most ungrudgingly devoted valuable time to making
transcriptions from needed authorities in the British
Museum, at a time when other duties debarred me from
access to books. My friend and former colleague,
Mr. W. Garmon Jones, Dean of the Faculty of Arts
of the University of Liverpool, gave me the benefit
of his ripe scholarship and fine judgment in reading
through the greater part of the work in manuscript,
though I need hardly say that any errors in statement
or opinion are to be attributed to me alone. I have to
thank the Rev. T. Shankland of this College for generously
undertaking the thankless task of reading the proofs,
and my Wife for the compilation of the Index and for
other help besides.</p>

<h2>PART I - HERESY</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I - ORIGINS OF MEDIÆVAL HERESY</h3>

<p>Ages of Faith—the term has often enough been applied
to the long era that separates the days of the Carolingian
empire from those of the Italian Renaissance. Like
most of the other generalizations that it is customary to
make of the Middle Ages the statement is true only with
important qualifications. It is with the qualifications
that this book is concerned. But to appreciate the exceptions,
it is first necessary to realize the full significance of
the rule—the very pregnant reality concerning Church
and State upon which the general statement is based.
That reality, the understanding of which is essential to
a grasp, not only of the ecclesiastical, but of any aspect
of mediæval history, is the magnificent conception of
the <i>Civitas Dei</i>. The Kingdom of God on earth was
conceived, not as a vision of the future, but as a living
and present reality—the Visible Church, Christendom.
Church and Christendom were one, for the Church was
catholic. The distinction which we of the modern
world, as the Renaissance and Reformation have made
it, are wont to make between Church and State, spiritual
and temporal, was wholly foreign to mediæval thought.
There was but one society, not two parallel societies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Society had indeed two aspects—one which looked to
things mundane and transient, the other which looked
to things heavenly and eternal. To safeguard its
earthly interests the world had its secular rulers and
administrators; to aid its spiritual life it had as guides
and mediators the sacred hierarchy. But the secular
rulers, on the one hand, and the priesthood, on the other,
were officers in the same polity. The secular authority
of the Empire was in the days of Frederick Barbarossa
acknowledged to be derived from the Pope by consecration;
later, as in Dante, it was conceived as collateral
with that of the Pope. But always the two authorities
were regarded as essentially related. It is true that
the reality never corresponded with the august theory,
that the <i>Respublica Christiana</i> never was universal,
that there were always those who disputed the authority
of Emperor or Pontiff or both; worse still, that
Christendom was distracted by bitter strife between
Emperor and Pontiff. But always such warfare was
regarded as domestic, not one between two different
states, but between two officers in one state.</p>

<p>It is important to bear in mind that the conception
of the universal church and empire was not regarded
simply as an idea which the philosopher and the publicist
wrote and disputed about, but as manifest in facts,
which every eye could see and every mind realize. There
actually existed an empire, an imperial crown and coronation;
there actually existed a Holy See and a ministering
priesthood. And the authority of the rulers of the
universal state was not simply vague and theoretical;
it was discernible in crusades, in pilgrimages, in the
‘Truce of God.’ Men realized themselves no doubt in
an ever increasing degree through the Middle Ages,
national characteristics becoming more and more pronounced,
as Englishmen, Frenchmen or Spaniards; but
they also thought of themselves quite naturally as
members together of the common society of Christendom.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>
<p>If we comprehend the <i>oneness</i> of human society in the
Middle Ages, as actively believed in by the average
thinking man and unquestioningly accepted as a patent
fact by the average uneducated man, we can realize what
is meant by the phrase ‘ages of faith’ and at the same
time avoid some of the pitfalls that lie in the path of
any one seeking to study the exceptions to the rule,
namely, the heresies of these ages of faith.</p>

<p>What were the conditions that generated heresy?
First, there were psychological conditions. In contrast
to the bustling and multiform activity of the modern
world the Middle Ages may at a first glance give an
impression of inactivity and sameness. Such an impression,
if it is encouraged by the intellectual dormancy
of the ninth and tenth and, in some degree, of the eleventh
centuries, is completely at variance with the facts of
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, in which the mind
of Western Christendom was very much awake indeed.
The impression also ignores what is one of the most
marked characteristics of mediæval history as a whole—the
clash and conflict and the dissonances of it. While
the idea of the universal empire still held sway, secular
princes, pursuing purely separatist ambitions, made
war one upon another and the nations of Europe were
in the throes of parturition. Typical of the incongruities
of mediæval life was the glaring contrast between the
glorious minster and the mean and filthy hovels round
it to be seen in every city; but that there was incongruity
in spending immense wealth, time and labour
on building a house for God to dwell in, while housing
themselves in dwellings rude and insanitary was not
apparent to the occupants. There was another incongruity
inside the churches themselves. Together with
images that were sacred and beautiful there were hideous
gargoyles, grotesque figures, whose inspiration was not
Christian but pagan. Congregated together were saints
and satyrs, and Pan is found in company with Christ.
Art was made the handmaiden of religion: that did
not mean that she was wholly consecrated. St. Bernard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
complained that the eyes of monks as they walked round
their cloisters were too often assailed by pictures which
could only awaken thoughts unsanctified. If the first
of these two discords is eloquent of the faith which set
the worship of God far before the common needs of
men, the second is indicative of that alien spirit, untamed
and powerful, which fights against the higher
nature and the devoted life. From rebellious nature
sprang all manner of unholy lusts and ambitions, productive
of wars and enmities and other kinds of evil,
which rendered the reality of human existence so
divergent from the Christian ideal. But Christianity
accepted these inevitable consequences of original sin,
providing through repentance and penance reconciliation
and the possibility of amendment. In the
elemental passions, however, the Church found itself
faced by a problem which presents one of the most
interesting features of the ecclesiastical history of the
Middle Ages.</p>

<p>It is ever a hard task to expel nature, and often,
where she has been renounced and thwarted, she has her
revenge by returning, clothed in her grossest forms. The
literature of the Thebaid and of mediæval hagiology is
eloquent testimony to the fact that extreme asceticism
and extreme profligacy are often found in close proximity.
The fugitive from the insurgent passions of his own being,
seeking to overcome the temptations of the flesh by
severe macerations and scourgings, has only too often
found his voluntary existence of self-discipline intolerable
without the relief of an occasional wild debauch or has
found that in his savage attempt to subdue the senses
he has come to take a sensual delight in self-torture and
that he is falling into the lowest depths of bestiality. The
very fervour of religious zeal in the Middle Ages is a token
of the fierceness of the passionate fires that tortured
men’s hearts. It was always doubtful what outlet these
fires would find. Would they glorify God in the
martyrdom of the lower nature or would they rage untamed,
flames solely of desire, destroying the soul? Was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
it a pure religious passion or a depraved sensual passion
that, when the Albigensian Crusade was being preached
in Germany, drove women who could not take the cross
to run naked through the streets in ecstasy? Which
was it that was really evidenced by the practices of the
Flagellants, who at one time obtained considerable
influence in different parts of Europe? They were simply
doing in public what the monk did in seclusion and in
the perfect odour of sanctity. The idea of bringing the
soul nearer to God by the wounding of the sinful flesh
had the Church’s fullest sanction. Yet the Flagellants
were eventually declared heretics. Why? Because it
became plain after a time that the motive of some
of those who joined the sect was unholy—not a desire
to seek salvation, but only a perverted lust. Secondly,
because alike the genuine and the false devotee were
moved in the excess of their strange enthusiasm to build
upon it a theory of the efficacy of flagellation which made
it the only means to salvation, a sacrament, indeed the
essential sacrament.</p>

<p>In yet another way the unregenerate part of man’s
nature might breed heresy. The lust not perhaps of the
flesh so much as of the eye and the pride of life led men
to take a delight in pleasure, in the sensuous pagan world,
that was not a wholly hallowed delight. Such superabundant
joy in life was apt to produce over-confidence
in the individual’s powers unaided by religion, leading
to presumption and disobedience. The phenomenon of
such rebelliousness in the later Middle Ages is sometimes
forgotten. Yet the legends of the blossoming pastoral
staff and of the Holy Grail pictured also the Venusberg
and the garden of Kundry’s flower-maidens. In remembering
the figures of the anchorite and the knight-errant
one must not lose sight of the troubadour and the
courtesan. Eloquent of the movement of revolt is the
famous passage in ‘Aucassin et Nicolette’ in which
Aucassin, threatened with the pains of hell if he persists
in his love for the mysterious southern maid, exclaims
that in that case to hell he will go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>For none go to Paradise but I’ll tell you who. Your
old priests and your old cripples, and the halt and maimed,
who are down on their knees day and night, before altars
and in old crypts; these also that wear mangy old cloaks,
or go in rags and tatters, shivering and shoeless and showing
their sores, and who die of hunger and want and misery.
Such are they who go to Paradise; and what have I to do
with them? Hell is the place for me. For to Hell go the
fine churchmen, and the fine knights, killed in the tourney
or in some grand war, the brave soldiers and the gallant
gentlemen. With them will I go. There go also the fair
gracious ladies who have lovers two or three beside their
lord. There go the gold and silver, the sables and the ermines.
There go the harpers and the minstrels and the kings of the
earth. With them will I go, so I have Nicolette my most
sweet friend with me.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Comparable with the fearless scepticism of this
romance is the outspoken unorthodoxy produced by the
intellectual ferment of the twelfth century. That epoch
which saw the new movement of monastic reform which
gave birth to the order of Grammont, of the Carthusians
and the Cistercians, is most notable in the history of the
universities—of Paris, Oxford, Bologna. From one to
another, from the feet of one learned doctor and teacher
to another, flocked wandering scholars athirst for pure
knowledge which, if it had a theological bias and a religious
garb, nevertheless inevitably tended to produce a spirit
of rationalism, to substitute freedom for discipline, the
individual consciousness for authority. The philosophy
of the day—the Scholastic Philosophy—sprang from
the concentration of the thought of theologians trained
in logic on the question of the relation between the
individual unit and the universal, the εἴδος: for if the
Middle Ages knew little of Plato they were conversant
with his doctrine of ideas. The scholastic philosophers
are remarkable for their great erudition within the
limitation of contemporary knowledge: but still more
for the extreme acuteness and subtlety which came from
their dialectical training. Such subtlety might at times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>be no better than verbal juggling; but it always indicated
alertness of mind. Such intellectual nimbleness was
generally at the service of the Church, to elucidate doctrine,
uphold and defend the Catholic faith. On the other
hand, the curious mind, even when starting with the
most innocent, most orthodox intent, was sometimes
beguiled into surmises and speculations of a dangerous
nature. Logic, if untrammelled, has a way of leading to
untraditional conclusions. When this happened it was
possible to escape from an awkward dilemma by submitting
that philosophy was one thing, theology another,
and that there could be two truths, in the two different
planes, subsisting together though mutually contradictory.
But this convenient compromise was obviously only a
pious subterfuge and grotesquely illogical. Unfortunately
both of the two principal schools of thought were prone
to lead to error. Realism, which found reality in the
universal substance, subordinating the individual to
humanity and humanity to the Godhead, logically led
to Pantheism; while Nominalism, finding reality solely
in each disjointed unit, if applied to theology, left no
choice except between Unitarianism and Tritheism. In
the year 1092 a nominalist philosopher Roscellinus was
condemned at Soissons for teaching Tritheism and denying
the Trinity. Another nominalist, Berengar of Tours,
skilfully dissected the doctrine of Transubstantiation,
which had grown up in its grossest form during the Dark
Ages and was first really developed in an answer to
Berengar by Anselm of Bec. There was a greater than
either Roscellinus or Berengar, who was neither a nominalist
nor a realist, but a conceptualist, the greatest of all
the wandering scholars of his time, gifted with extraordinary
vividness of personality and brilliance of intellect.
Abelard’s love story in the world of actual fact is as
wonderful as that of Aucassin in the world of romance.
His teaching has the same note of freedom and fearlessness
as that which sounds so clear in the old French story.
There was nothing very alarming in his doctrines; his
conclusions were generally orthodox enough. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the methods by which he arrived at those conclusions
that aroused the fear and the wrath of his adversaries.
For he put Christian dogma to the touchstone of reason,
accepting it because it was reasonable, not following
reason just as far as it was Christian. To St. Bernard,
Abelard appeared as a virulent plague-spot, a second
Arius. But there were coming other heresies of a more
disturbing nature, for the source of whose influence if
not inspiration we must seek among facts of a different
character.</p>

<p>Though their extent is certainly a matter of dispute,
there is no doubt about the fact of serious clerical abuses
in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. There is no need
here to trench upon contentious ground; and it should
be said that when a catalogue of offences is produced as
a picture of the mediæval church without giving the
other side of the picture, only a most erroneous impression
can be created. There was extraordinary greatness in
a church that could produce a St. Bernard, a St. Francis,
an Anselm, a Grosseteste. Yet even if we leave out of
account the invectives of professed enemies altogether
and only rely upon the unimpeachable authority of the
Church’s leaders themselves, we are left with rather
a dark picture. We must remember that would-be
reformers are prone to indulge in highly coloured language
with reference to the evils they seek to eradicate. Yet,
simony must have been a crying abuse, or it would not
have received so much attention from zealous pontiffs.
We know too of many bishops who neglected their spiritual
duties and were nothing more than feudal barons, sometimes
fattening upon riches amassed by extortion. It
cannot be denied that there were numerous instances of
absenteeism and pluralities; while for the sexual immorality
to be found among both regular and secular
clergy we have the excellent authority of great men who
were scandalized by it and sought to produce amendment,
such as Honorius III, St. Bernard and Bishop Grosseteste.
Monastic reforms had been tried, the Cluniac being
followed by the Cistercian and others of a like severity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
A fine attempt had been made to assist the endeavour
of the parish priest to strive after personal holiness by
the institution of the orders of the Praemonstratensians
and the Austin Friars. And much good was unquestionably
accomplished; yet order after order eventually fell
away from its pristine purity and the seed of corruption
remained uneradicated. At the very least, we can say
that most men must have had from personal experience
knowledge of some glaring contrast between clerical
profession and accomplishment. That some such contrast
should at all times in greater or less degree exist is only
the inevitable result of the weaknesses of human nature.
It has invariably been the case, however, that when the
ministers of a religion have failed to proclaim their gospel
in their lives as well as in their preaching, they have
sowed doubt and distrust and lost adherents.</p>

<p>Bishop Grosseteste told Pope Innocent IV that the
corruption of the priesthood was the source of the heresies
which troubled the Church.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> We may feel sure that
it was <i>one</i> source at all events when we note in the twelfth
century a most marked revival of the Donatist doctrine
that the sacrament is polluted in sinful hands. By
similar reasoning the score of a great composer might
be regarded as tainted for our hearing because the members
of the orchestra performing it were not all high-minded
men. That would be similar reasoning: but it would
not be the same. Skill in his art is what we expect from
the musician; without it he cannot mediate between
the composer and his audience, he cannot interpret the
music, he can only jar and lacerate the feelings of his
hearers. There is the skill also of the priest. He has
to interpret spiritual things and needs therefore to be
spiritually-minded. God may not be dependent upon
the worthiness of His interpreters; none the less their
unworthiness may jar upon and lacerate the feelings of
worshippers, conscious of the scandal of such unworthiness.
When, for example, priests are found abusing the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>fessional
by actually soliciting their female penitents to
sin, a moral revulsion against such a practice is inevitable.
Such a revulsion may in some cases generate an
attack upon the whole system of confession—and that is
heresy.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>An intense dissatisfaction with the moral condition
of the world, more especially as revealed in the Church,
is one of the dominant features of the neo-Manichæan
heresy, known as Catharism or Paulicinianism, of Waldensianism,
of Joachitism. The last actually postulated
that Christianity had failed and that mankind
stood in need of a new revelation and a new Saviour.
Corruption in the Church was, then, one of the contributory
causes of mediæval heresy, and anti-sacerdotalism
was one of its features.</p>

<p>It must not be assumed, however, that because
heretical sects protested against scandals in the Church,
they necessarily exhibited a higher standard of morality
themselves. The reverse is in some cases the truth.
Among the heresiarchs and their followers are found
men who were mere half-crazed fanatics, others whose
passion was more of lust than for righteousness. We
have to bear in mind that our knowledge of the heretics
is almost entirely derived from their adversaries;
unbiased contemporary testimony there is none. Yet,
even remembering this, we can appreciate the repugnance
which many heretical sects inspired in their own day.
In the second place, the Church was itself alive to the
need of reform. The best minds always were; and to
all the outbreak of heresies in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, though it was so ruthlessly and thoroughly
suppressed, was a significant warning. Unhappily the
abuses actually tended to increase in the fourteenth
century, and the papacy in particular lost heavily in
moral and spiritual authority when it allowed itself to
become the mere catspaw of the French monarchy at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>Avignon, when it became rent asunder by the even
greater disaster of the Schism.</p>

<p>But the task of the Church in reforming itself was
one of very great difficulty. It was essential in purifying
conduct to take the utmost precautions against
adulterating the purity of the faith, in reforming the
papacy to maintain the fundamental continuity of
the Church, of its orders, its sacraments, its traditions.
Individual would-be reformers were carried away by
their perfervid zeal, led into proposing the most unheard-of
innovations. Wycliffe actually demanded the sweeping
away of the higher orders of the priesthood and
the monastic orders as a condition of the suppression
of corruption. Such theories were clearly heretical,
and it was no solvent of the spiritual troubles of the
Church to weaken it still further by making concessions
to revolutionaries, by invalidating sound
doctrine. Such was the point of view of moderate
reformers like Gerson, D’Ailly, Niem—men perhaps
just as earnest as Wycliffe and Hus in their desire for
purity, but anxious, as these were not, for the preservation
of the Catholic faith untouched. And it is
easy to understand the position they adopted. The
general conditions of their time, political and social
as well as religious, made a strong appeal to the conservative
instinct. England and France were both
suffering from the havoc of the Hundred Years War.
There was schism in the empire as well as in the papacy.
The terrible scourge of the Black Death laid all countries
low. Social unrest was widespread and alarming.
Vagrant, masterless men devoured with avidity any
doctrines of a communist saviour, and to such the
Wycliffite thesis of dominion founded on grace had
an obvious and dangerous attractiveness. Just as in
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, so now in the case
of Wycliffitism and Husitism, heresy was regarded not
as a purely religious matter, but also as a social danger.
Another phenomenon which conservatives naturally
viewed with misgiving was early translations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Scriptures into the vernacular. Parallel to the peril
of revolution from social ideas among the servile classes
of the community was that of the ‘open’ Bible among
the ignorant, uninstructed laity. For many reasons,
then, the conservatives were prompted to be cautious.
Their heroic attempt to secure reform from within—made
in the great Conciliar movement—definitely
failed. It failed in the main because it was not
sufficiently drastic, and because, while it healed the
Schism, it did not secure the moral elevation of the
papacy. The Council of Basel proposed the most
elaborate measures for reform; but they were never
confirmed by the papacy. The loftiest aspirations were
represented within the Church. They had always been.
The Canon law had been clear and unequivocal enough
on the subject of clerical conduct. The difficulty lay in
making these aspirations, reflected alike in the Canon
law and in the proposals of the Councils, thoroughly
effective.</p>

<p>The history of mediæval heresy takes us as far as
the Conciliar movement. There we stand on the threshold
of the modern world, the scene changes, with new
actors and a new atmosphere. The Protestant Reformation
is much more familiar than the earlier movements.
Yet the subject of these is one of great and
manifold interest. For the heresies of the Middle Ages
were of various types and arose from a variety of causes.
Broadly speaking, we may say that any circumstances
which tended to break up the unity of the <i>Civitas Dei</i>,
whether in the sphere of action or of theory, might be
productive of heresy. That is obviously a very rough
generalization indeed; but only broad generalization can
include such diverse sources of heresy as the obsessions of
fanatics like Eon de l’Etoile and Dolcino, the dialectical
disputations of theologians like Roscellinus and philosophers
like Siger, the anti-sacerdotalism of Waldenses
and Cathari, the profounder searchings of heart and
mind that inspired the revolts of Wycliffe and Hus.
Nor must we forget the influence of the political factor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the contention between papacy and secular princes
regarding rights and jurisdiction, which was a potent
encouragement to controversy. Such strife, where in
theory there should have been complete harmony, was
in itself productive of doubt and unsettlement. The
very heinousness of heresy to the mediæval mind lay
largely in its challenge to the essential social, ecclesiastical,
doctrinal unity of Christendom. Whether
the springs of its being were an emotional afflatus, a
moral revulsion, or an intellectual ferment, heresy was
in any case a challenge to the existing order. Its
adherents were always a comparatively small and
unpopular minority. Society as a whole regarded it
as dangerous and was convinced of the necessity of
its repression. By far the most important, as it is the
most notorious, instrument devised for the repression
of heresy in the Middle Ages was the tribunal of the
Inquisition.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER II - WALDENSES AND CATHARI</h3>

<p>In the year 1108 there appeared in Antwerp a certain
eloquent zealot named Tanchelm. Apparently there
existed in Antwerp only one priest, and he was living
in concubinage. In these circumstances the enthusiast
easily obtained a remarkable influence in the city, as he
had already done in the surrounding Flanders country.
His preaching was anti-sacerdotal, and he maintained
the Donatist doctrine concerning the Sacrament. He
declared indeed that owing to the degeneracy of the
clergy the sacraments had become useless, even harmful,
the authority of the Church had vanished. He is also
credited with having given himself out to be of divine
nature, the equal of Christ, with having celebrated his
nuptials with the Virgin Mary, with having been guilty
of vile promiscuous excesses, with having made such
claims as that the ground on which he trod was holy
and that if sick persons drank of water in which he had
bathed they would be cured. We need not necessarily
take these stories seriously. Our knowledge of Tanchelm
and his followers is derived mainly from St. Norbert,
Archbishop of Magdeburg and founder of the Praemonstratensian
order, who after the leader’s death
undertook the task of winning back his followers to the
true faith. The evidence comes, as usual in these cases,
entirely from hostile sources, and may easily be based on
credulous gossip. Certain it does, however, appear to
be that the man succeeded in obtaining a remarkable
influence, surrounding himself with a bodyguard of 300
men and making himself a power and even a terror
throughout the neighbourhood. That he cannot have
regarded himself as an apostate is clear from his having
paid a visit to Rome in 1112 on the question of the
division of the bishopric of Utrecht. On the way back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
he was, together with his followers, seized by the Archbishop
of Cologne. Three of the disciples were burned
at Bonn; he himself escaped, to be killed three years
later by a clout on the head administered by an avenging
priest.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>Somewhat similar to Tanchelm, but indubitably
a madman, was Eudo or Eon de l’Etoile, who created
trouble a little later on in Brittany, declaring himself
to be the son of God. The madman had convinced
himself of his divine origin from reading a special reference
to himself in the words: ‘Per <i>eum</i> qui venturus est
judicare vivos et mortuos.’ Eon, in virtue of this high
claim, plundered churches and monasteries, giving their
property to the poor, nominated angels and apostles
and ordained bishops. It is not easy to be certain as
to the extent of his influence; for it is not possible to
tell whether there was any direct connection between
him and a sect who were spread abroad in Brittany
about the same time, 1145-8, but were connected with
others calling themselves Apostolic Brethren who, having
their headquarters within the diocese of Châlons, were
found in most of the northern provinces of France, their
main tenets being that baptism before the age of thirty,
at which Christ Himself was baptized, was useless, that
there was no resurrection of the body, that property,
meat and wine were to be adjured.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Of much more serious consequence than either of
these two fanatics was Arnold of Brescia, who, a pupil
of the errant Abelard and accused of sharing his master’s
heterodoxies, was proclaiming a much more inconvenient
heresy when he invoked the ancient republican ideals of
the city of Rome, maintaining that the papal authority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>within the city was an usurpation; and indeed that the
whole temporal power of the papacy and all the temporal
concerns of the Church as a whole were an usurpation—so
that his crusade in Rome involved a larger crusade
against the alleged secularism, wealth and worldliness
of the clergy.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> After his death, there remained a certain
obscure sect of Arnoldists, calling themselves ‘Poor Men,’
a devoted unworldliness their gospel, who no doubt
provided a receptive organism in which the later culture
of Waldensianism might thrive.</p>

<p>But it was neither in the Low Countries and northern
France nor in Italy that heresy was first recognized as
a formidable menace. The danger came from southern
France, particularly from Provence, from the country
of the <i>langue d’oc</i>. In the fertile and beautiful territories
of the Counts of Toulouse, between the Rhone and the
Pyrenees, a land altogether distinct from the rest of
France, where there was a vernacular language and
literature much earlier than elsewhere in Europe, there
existed a civilization unique, vivid and luxuriant. It
was distinctive in that it was not in inspiration and
essential character Catholic, for it owed much to intercourse
with the Moors from across the Pyrenees, whose
trade, whose special knowledge and skill, in particular
medical skill, were welcomed there. The population
was itself of mixed origin, having in it even Saracenic
elements. This Provençal country, peculiar in
Christendom, was pre-eminently the land of chivalry,
of the troubadour, of romance and poetry and the
adventures of love, of all the grace and mirth and
joyousness that were in the Middle Ages. Clearly the
atmosphere was not religious, the Church had little
influence and the priesthood were disliked and despised.
It was an atmosphere in which any anti-sacerdotal
heresy might flourish.</p>

<p>In this country there was preaching early in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>twelfth century a certain Pierre de Bruys, denouncing
infant baptism, image-worship, the Real Presence in the
Sacrament, the veneration of the Cross. He declared
indeed that the Cross—simply the piece of wood on which
the Saviour was tortured—should be regarded as an
object rather of execration than of veneration. As
nothing save the individual’s own faith could help him,
vain and useless were churches and prayers and masses
for the dead. No symbol had efficacy; only personal
righteousness. Pierre de Bruys was burnt, but a small
sect of Petrobrusians survived him for several years,
their heresies being dissected by Peter the Venerable
of Cluny.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>Much more numerous and more troublesome than the
Petrobrusians were the followers of Henry, a monk of
Lausanne, of whose original doctrines little is known save
that he rejected the invocation of saints and preached
an ascetic doctrine, with which was inevitably associated
a denunciation of worldliness among the clergy. Later
on he became more venturesome, rejecting the Sacrament
and avowing many of the tenets of Pierre de Bruys. So
successful was his teaching in the south of France that
St. Bernard was wellnigh in despair. Christianity seemed
almost banished out of Languedoc. With fiery zeal
Bernard threw himself into the work of reclamation,
and apparently met with much success, the refusal of
Henry of Lausanne to meet him in a disputation going
a long way to discredit his influence. His sect survived
his death, the nature of which is uncertain. It is possible
that the Apostolic Brethren found in Brittany and elsewhere
in France, if they were not connected with Eon
de l’Etoile, were really Henricians.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief interest of the heresies so far mentioned
is the indication they afford of the potential popularity
of any anti-sacerdotal propaganda. Apart from the
crusade of Arnold of Brescia, which had a special significance
of its own belonging less to the history of dogma
than of politics, none of the movements had within
them the power of inspiration and sincerity to make them
of permanent influence and importance. It was otherwise
with the movement set on foot by Peter Waldo, a
wealthy merchant of Lyons, uncultured and unlearned,
but filled with an intense zeal for the Scriptures and for
the rule of genuine godliness. From diligent study
of the New Testament and the Fathers he came to the
conclusion that the laws of Christ were nowhere strictly
obeyed. Resolved to live a Christ-like life himself, he
gave part of his property to his wife and distributed the
proceeds of the remainder among the poor. He then
started to preach the gospel in the streets, and soon
attracted admirers and adherents, who joined him in
preaching in private houses, public places and churches.
As priests had been very neglectful of that part of their
duty, the preaching apparently had something of the
charm of novelty.</p>

<p>The small band, adopting the garb as well as the
reality of poverty, came to be known as the Poor Men
of Lyons. At first their ministrations were approved,
and even when the Archbishop of Lyons prohibited
their preaching and excommunicated them, the Pope,
Alexander III, appealed to by Waldo, gave his benediction
to his vow of poverty and expressly sanctioned
the preaching of himself and his followers, provided
they had the permission of the priests. This proviso,
however, in time came to be disregarded, and the Poor
Men, becoming more and more embittered in their
denunciation of clerical abuses, began to mingle erroneous
doctrines with their anti-sacerdotalism. The clergy,
who naturally resented the onslaught upon their alleged
shortcomings, resented also the usurpation of the function
of preaching. It was not difficult to maintain that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
usurpation was itself indicative of heresy. Richard,
monk of Cluny, writing against the Waldenses near the
close of the century, while admitting the merit of the
rich man in voluntarily embracing poverty, on the
other hand found that Waldo read the Scriptures with
little understanding, that he was
proud in his own conceit, and possessing a little learning
assumed to himself and usurped the office of the Apostles,
preaching the Gospel in the streets and squares. He caused
many men and women to become his accomplices in a like
presumption, whom he sent to preach as his disciples. They
being simple and illiterate people, traversing the village
and entering into the houses, spread everywhere many
errors.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>That they were a heretical sect and no part of the true
Church is demonstrated by Moneta, the chief authority on
Waldensianism, from the question of orders. Who gave
the Poor Men of Lyons their orders, without which there
can be no Christian Church? No one but Waldo himself!
From whom did Waldo obtain them? No one. Waldo
‘glorified himself to be a bishop; in consequence he was
an antichrist, against Christ and His Church.’<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> From
preaching it was an easy transition to hearing confessions,
absolving sins, enjoining penances. The Poor Men came
eventually to undertake all these offices. By the time
of the Council of Verona of 1184, when the attitude that
the Church ought to adopt towards the new organization
was first seriously discussed as a matter of urgent moment,
the points of importance were—that the Waldenses
refused obedience to the clergy, held that laymen and
even women had the right to preach, that masses for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>dead were useless, and that God was to be obeyed rather
than man.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>The last article is clearly a butting against sacerdotal
authority. In fact, anti-sacerdotalism is still the real
sum and substance of the teaching. There was no
explicit doctrinal, intellectual error of the first magnitude.
Implicitly, however, there was; for underlying the
whole Waldensian propaganda lay a heretical principle:
that which bestows authority to exercise priestly functions
is not ordination at all, but merit and the individual’s
consciousness of vocation.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>The Church felt Waldensianism to be a serious
menace because it speedily became popular and spread
rapidly. The Poor Men later came to believe themselves
the true Church, from which Catholicism had
in its corruption fallen away. And in support of this
they were wont to point to their own personal purity.
To secure godliness was ever their main concern. A
simple adherent of the Waldensian creed, interrogated
as to the precepts his instructors had inculcated,
explained that they had taught him ‘that he should
neither speak nor do evil, that he should do nothing to
others that he would not have done to himself, and
that he should not lie or swear.’<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>It would be difficult to find an apter summary of
the ideals of Christian conduct! On certain points of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>behaviour the Waldenses laid particular stress—perhaps
most of all upon the necessity of scrupulous truthfulness;
and like many people who have a keen sense
of the compelling beauty of truth for its own sake, they
strongly disapproved of the taking of oaths.</p>

<p>Simple goodness and high-mindedness have rarely
at any time of history failed to make their appeal to
men’s hearts; and it is clear that in the Middle Ages
especially a strict rule of life, particularly if it had something
austere and ascetic in it, held a remarkable attraction
and influence. A writer, inveighing against the
Waldenses towards the end of the fourteenth century,
admits the efficacy of their purity in promoting their
teaching. ‘Because their followers saw and daily see
them endowed with exterior godliness, and a good many
priests of the Church (O shame!) entangled with vice,
chiefly of lust, they believed that they are better absolved
from sins through them than through the priests of the
Church.’<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> An inquisitor bears testimony—and no
testimony could be less biased in their favour—to the
moral excellence of the sect. ‘Heretics,’ he goes so far
as to say, ‘are recognized by their customs and speech,
for they are modest and well-regulated. They take no
pride in their garments, which are neither costly nor
vile. They do not engage in trade, to avoid lies and
oaths and frauds, but live by their labours as mechanics—their
teachers are cobblers. They do not accumulate
wealth, but are content with necessaries. They are
chaste and temperate in meat and drink. They do not
frequent taverns or dances or other vanities. They
restrain themselves from anger. They are always at
work; they teach and learn and consequently pray
but little. They are to be known by their modesty
and precision of speech, avoiding scurrility and detraction,
light words and lies and oaths.’<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> That the
Waldenses should sometimes have been accused of
hypocrisy and have met with ridicule from sophisticated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>enemies is not surprising; but generally there is striking
evidence as to their simple piety. There were some stories
told at times of sexual immorality among them. These
we need not take very seriously. Similar stories were
told against all heretical sects; and they can be accounted
for easily in this case by a confusion found frequently
between the Waldenses and the Cathari. The preponderating
evidence in favour of the moral excellence of
the former is strong. It is not perhaps too much to
say that the distinctive dangerousness of the former
lay in the fact of such excellence, such fruits of the spirit
being brought forth among a sect which arrogated to
itself apostolic functions without lawful authority.</p>

<p>The other great contemporary heresy—Catharism—has
some striking points of resemblance with
Waldensianism, but more important points of contrast.
The new Manichæism emanated from the East, being
found in the Balkans in the tenth century tolerated
and flourishing under John Zimiskes, especially in Thrace
and Bulgaria, after a period of attempted extirpation
under Leo the Isaurian and Theodora. The Manichæan
belief appeared in Italy about 1030, and speedily made
its way into France, first entering Aquitaine, then
spreading over the whole country south of the Loire.
Early in the twelfth century it penetrated further north—into
Champagne, Picardy, Flanders; and at the same
time in one form or another it was found in Hungary,
Bohemia, Germany. It was so far-spread indeed that
its existence presented a very serious problem for the
Church.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>There were several varieties of Manichæan doctrine,
corresponding with the different sects of Bogomiles,
as they were called in Bulgaria and other Slavic lands,
Paulicians among the Greeks, Cathari in Western
Europe; but the different varieties were united in their
fundamental dualism. The Manichæan idea started in
an attempt to find a solution for the problem of good
and evil presented by the assumption that God the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Creator is all-good and all-wise.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Could such a Creator
be the author of all the evil abroad in the world? Yet
evil could not be fortuitous; the material universe
presented too much evidence of purpose and design.
A creator of the evil there must have been; but an
evil person or principle. To this creator—call him
Satan or Lucifer, what you will—must be due sin and
such disasters as famines, wars and tempests.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>For such a dualism—two creators, one beneficent,
the other malign—the Catharan discovered abundant
evidence in the Scriptures. In the Temptation Satan
offers Christ all the glories of the earth, which must
mean that they, constituting the material world, belong
to Satan.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> There were numerous passages descriptive
of the discrepancy between the earthly and the heavenly.
Christ said, ‘My Kingdom is not of this world.’ One
Catharan tenet was that Jehovah, the God of the Old
Testament, was the malign creator. For he was a
sanguinary deity, dealing in curses and violence, wars
and massacres. What single point in common, urged
the Catharan, was there between this deity and that
of the New Testament, who desired mercy and forgiveness?
The Catharan dubbed Jehovah a deceiver,
a thief, a vulgar juggler. He strongly condemned the
Mosaic law, declaring it radically evil. Had it not
been entirely abrogated by the law of Christ, according
to Christ’s own statement?<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>There were differences among the Manichæans as
to whether the evil deity was equal to the other or
not. The Bogomiles believed that God had two sons,
the younger Jesus, the elder Satan, who was entrusted
with the administration of the celestial kingdom and
the creative power. Satan revolted, was turned out
of heaven, and thereupon created a new world and,
with Adam and Eve, a new race of beings. Another
Manichæan system saw in Lucifer, not a son of God,
but an angel, expelled from heaven. Two other
angels—Adam and Eve—agreed to share his exile.
In order to secure their permanent allegiance to himself
Satan created Paradise to drive the idea of heaven
from their minds. Not satisfied with this device he
hit upon another—the union of the sexes. He
accordingly entered into the serpent and tempted Eve,
awakening the carnal appetite, which is original sin,
and has ever since been the main source of the continuance
of the Devil’s power.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>The Manichæans of all sections regarded Jesus as
having been sent by the good God to destroy the power
of the evil one by bringing back the seed of Adam to
heaven. In their view Jesus was inferior to God,
not God Himself, but rather the highest of the angels.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
Denying His divinity, they also denied His humanity.
For holding Satan to be essentially the lord of the
material world and the originator of the propagation
of the human race, they could not allow that Christ’s
body was of the same substance as of the ordinary
man. According to them, the transfiguration was
Christ’s revelation of His celestial body to the
disciples.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> The Passion and Crucifixion had no
significance for the Cathari. Indeed Christ’s death
was a delusion. The Devil tried to kill Jesus, under
the impression that His body was vulnerable; whereas
in reality it was as invulnerable as His spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>There was, therefore, no death, and of course no
resurrection.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>The dogma of the expiatory character of Christ’s
life the Cathari necessarily rejected. He came, according
to them, solely to teach the duty of penitence and to
show the way to salvation, which lay only through
membership of the Catharan church.</p>

<p>The Virgin Mary possessed the same form of celestial
body as Christ; though apparently a woman, she was
actually sexless. Some Cathari held that the Virgin
was only symbolical—of the Catharan church.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Some,
too, held that John the Baptist was one of the demons
of the evil god, who acted as an obstacle to the beneficent
God, by preaching the material baptism of water instead
of the true baptism which is purely spiritual.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>Such were some of the main doctrinal features of
Catharism. Its ethical teaching was intimately connected
with its theology. Refusing to credit that the
good God could predestine any to perdition, they held
that salvation ultimately awaited all. What gain, in
these circumstances, had the Catharan over his unconverted
neighbours? Only a gain in point of time. Life
on earth, the Devil’s domain, was thought of as a dwelling
in and with corruption, a penance, a probation. The
aim was to have done with such life, such probation, as
soon as might be. The unbeliever, though he eventually
reached heaven, did not do so immediately after death,
but had to continue his penance in another material
form. One of the essential ideas of Catharism, then,
was the transmigration of souls.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> But for the Catharan,
death meant the instant discarding of the filthy garment
of the decadent flesh, the entrance at once into glory.</p>

<p>It was in the ability to cast aside the bondage of the
material world that there consisted the Catharan’s
supreme advantage over other people. The feeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>that this <i>was</i> an advantage clearly depended on one’s
attitude towards human life. To the Catharan the
essential sin was worldliness. The Catharan made no
distinction between mortal and venial sins for this reason.
All concern and pleasure in the affairs of the world was
mortal sin. Money-making was of course depraved;
but so also was devotion to parents, children, friends.
Had not Christ said as much?<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> The Catharan must
give up everything he held dear in life for the sake of
the truth, which was the Catharan faith.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> While the
Bogomiles sanctioned prevarication in order to escape
persecution, the stricter adherents of the creed combined
together with a Waldensian devotion to strict
truthfulness without oaths, a conviction that to deny
the smallest article of their faith was a heinous offence.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>His belief in metempsychosis meant that the Catharan
was a vegetarian. He abjured cheese, milk and eggs
as well as meat; but flesh was worst of all, because all
flesh is of the Devil.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> But the human spirit was regarded
with the greatest sanctity. The effusion of blood was
always wrong, the circumstances made no difference—it
was always murder. The parricide was no wickeder
than the soldier in battle or the judge condemning the
criminal to death.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> No human being was ever justified
in preventing his fellow men from following out their
own course to salvation. It may seem at first sight
curious that the Catharan, so strongly condemning the
taking of another’s life, should in certain cases condone
and even encourage suicide. The explanation is, however,
simple enough. Once granted the conception of
the radically evil nature of the world and, secondly, of
entrance into the Catharan fold as ensuring immediate
entrance into glory without further probation after
death, it was legitimate for a believer, conscious of his
having accomplished the object of his earthly penance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>and made his salvation secure, to hasten the time of his
departure into heaven. Hence the initiated would
sometimes escape the sufferings of illness, or the recent
convert flee from the temptation of the desire for the
temporal things he had renounced, by suicide. Such
Catharan suicide was known as the Endura.</p>

<p>Yet more remarkable than the sanction of suicide
was another consequence of the Manichæan creed—the
condemnation of matrimony.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> The connection of thought
was logical and the conclusion perhaps logically inevitable.
If it be accepted that the carnal body is the invention
of the Devil and the propagation of the species his device
for prolonging his power, the love of the sexes original
sin, then it is clear that marriage is service of Satan.
So the Cathari enjoined the severest possible chastity.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
As usual they found evidence of their belief in the Bible.
But for them there was no difference between one form
of sexual intercourse and another. Adultery, even
incest, was not one whit more iniquitous than marriage.
On the whole they were rather less evil. For adultery
was only temporary and produced a feeling of shame;
whereas marriage was permanent, a lasting living in sin,
contemplated without shame. The bearing of children was
regarded with horror. Every birth was a new triumph for
the evil one; a pregnant woman was possessed of the Devil,
and if she died pregnant, could not at once be saved.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>Catharan beliefs inevitably involved the denunciation
of Catholicism.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> It was the Catholic that was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>heretic; the wearer of the pontifical tiara could not
possibly be even a disciple of Him who wore a crown
of thorns, was indeed antichrist. The clergy from the
highest to the lowest were pharisees; the sacraments—infant
baptism, the sacrificial mass—were declared to
have no warrant in Scripture, to be mere figments of
the imagination.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>The Cathari, it has to be remembered, were a church.
They had an organization, held services with a certain
very simple ritual, for example substituting for the
mass a simple blessing of bread at table, the Catharan
meal bearing a close resemblance to the early Christian
ἀγάπη. Confessions were made to elders of the church
once a month. But the most distinctive ceremony
of the sect was the Consolamentum, an imposition of
hands whereby the ordinary believer was admitted
into the select ranks of the Perfected. The number of
the latter was always small, and consisted principally
of the avowed ministers of the faith. The Consolamentum,
which meant re-entrance into communion
with the spiritual world, was the desire of all true
Cathari, but was apt to be postponed until late in life,
often until the death-bed. The actual ritual of the
Consolamentum—or hæretication, as Catholics termed
it—was very brief. The candidate, after a series of
genuflections and blessings, asked the minister to pray
God that he might be made a good Christian.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> Such
prayer having been offered, the candidate was then
asked if he was willing to abjure prohibited foods and
unchastity, and to endure persecution if necessary.
When the Consolamentum was given to a man on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>death-bed, it was frequently followed by the Endura,
which commonly took the form of suffocation or self-starvation.</p>

<p>The Perfected consisted of four orders—bishop, filius
major, filius minor, deacon—their duties being to preside
at services and missionary work, in which the Cathari
were zealous. Outside their ranks were the simple
adherents, the Believers or, as they were sometimes
called, Christians. These bound themselves eventually
to receive the Consolamentum; but, generally speaking,
they were under no obligations save to venerate the
Perfected who, in the strictest sense, composed the
true Catharan Church, and to live the pure life their
faith enjoined. But they were under no coercive
authority, and were even permitted to marry.</p>

<p>Wherein lay the attraction of the Catharan doctrine
and system? For evidently they were attractive, as
their great and rapid spread over Europe shows. It
is at first difficult to discern anything attractive in
teaching so austere; and if the Catharan promised
a reward in heaven, so also did the Catholic. In his
case purgatory had first to be faced, but then the ordeal
on earth was less exacting. There would appear to
be two explanations, the one high-minded, the other
the reverse. In its early days the gospel of Catharism
probably made to some a lofty appeal. It denounced
palpable clerical abuses, repugnant to the moral consciousness.
The austerity of its ethical principles
seemed to point to a higher standard of living in days
when any outstanding examples of asceticism, whether
in the Church or outside it, evoked admiration. In
its hatred for the evil spirit of materialism, in its detestation
particularly of that worst of human passions,
cruelty, there was an element of nobility which finds
a response in the instinct which we to-day call humanitarian.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
In so far as its appeal was of this nature, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>was sincere and fine. Unhappily, however, Catharism
unquestionably developed another appeal of a wholly
different character, which resulted almost inevitably
from the complete impracticableness of its ideal. A
creed that approved of suicide and denounced marriage
stands self-condemned. It was at war with the very
principles of life itself. The ascetic rule it enjoined
was one ‘more honoured in the breach than the
observance.’ There was taint of unhealthiness and
corruption in a rule so hopelessly at variance with
nature; while a creed which, if it meant anything, held
as its highest hope the speediest possible destruction
of all human life, was devoid of the balance and sanity
which is essential in any doctrine that is to be of any
practical service in the world. Such a religion as
Catharism could not harmonize with the most elementary
facts of life and human nature. The consequence was—and
herein lies the greatest condemnation of the sect—that
it went on proclaiming an impracticable ideal
while admitting that it was impracticable, sanctioning
a compromise, itself antithetical to its essential dogma,
whereby alone the heresy was able to continue at all.
The compromise is seen in two practices—the distinction
made between the Perfected and the Believers and
the postponement of the Consolamentum, or complete
initiation, until the end of life. The Believers—the
great bulk of the adherents of the creed—might do
pretty well as they liked, in fact ignore all the Catharan
precepts of conduct, might marry, have riches, make
war, eat what they chose, provided only they were
prepared to receive the Consolamentum before they
died. Such an arrangement is merely the apotheosis
of the system of the death-bed repentance, it is an
encouragement to insincerity and hypocrisy. This does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>not mean that most, or necessarily even many, Cathari
were hypocrites. Most of them, probably, were originally
simple-minded labourers and artisans, attracted by a
novel gospel, which discerned the evils of the times,
gave hopes of heaven and was marked by the ascetic
and missionary enthusiasms which were then regarded as
the hall-mark of a spiritual origin and divine inspiration.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the temptation to insincerity was
clearly present. ‘Believe in the Catharan creed,
venerate the Perfected, receive the Consolamentum
before death,’ made a simple and an attractive faith
for one who wished to enjoy the pleasures of life to the
full, yet to whom the tortures of a material hell were
painfully vivid. ‘We are the only true Christians, the
Catholic church is but an usurpation, utterly corrupt,’
made a convenient excuse for the feudal lord, by whom
only the excuse was wanted, to harry the clergy and
make inroads on their property. Nor need we wonder
that these holders of a doctrine of ultra-asceticism, of
a complete celibacy, were credited with even the foulest
of sexual orgies. The distinction between Perfected
and Believers was an antinomian arrangement. Intense
asceticism among the very select number of the former
was made compatible with excesses among the latter.
Was not the very rigour of existence among the completely
initiated an invitation positively to extreme
indulgence prior to such initiation? It would be highly
uncritical to place a great deal of credence in the many
stories told of immoral practices among Cathari. Such
stories were bound to be told. We find them in connection
with practically every mediæval heresy; it was
such an obvious device for the discrediting of unholy
beliefs to demonstrate that they involved unholy lives.
But it would also be uncritical to reject the stories
altogether. There is an inherent probability that a
certain percentage—it may be only a small percentage—of
those told of the Cathari were true. The critic’s
objection, ‘what abomination may one not expect of
those who hold incest no worse a crime than marriage?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>’
is pertinent and sound.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> What results are likely, once
given the impossibility of complete continence, from
such a perverted teaching?</p>

<p>Indeed, notwithstanding its better qualities, its
still better possibilities, Catharism was essentially perverted:
and the antagonism it aroused and the efforts
made to suppress it are in no way surprising. It has
been termed ‘a hodge-podge of pagan dualism and gospel
teaching, given to the world as a sort of reformed
Christianity.’<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> A hodge-podge it undoubtedly was, an
amalgam of ancient Manichæism and elements of eastern
origin, which were not Christian at all but Mazdeist,
together with certain features of pure Christianity.
It is no wonder that the Catholic Church viewed with
alarm the challenge made by a faith so compounded
when it claimed to be the only true Christianity.
Catharism was not an antagonist to be despised. Its
missionary enterprise, its anti-social tendencies and the
evident popularity of its anti-sacerdotal features made
it undeniably dangerous. Moreover, it did not stand
alone. Taken together, the different anti-sacerdotal
heresies, of which Waldensianism and Catharism were
the chief, which were abroad in Europe before the end
of the twelfth century, presented a serious problem
and indeed a menace. Was not the widespread phenomenon
of organized heresy a challenge to the whole
conception of the <i>Civitas Dei</i> alike on its spiritual and
its secular side? If only in self-defence must not the
Church—society on its spiritual side—take special
measures to counteract the influence of rebels, who
had deliberately made war upon it by declaring themselves
alone to be the true repositories of the sacred
truths upon which God’s Kingdom here upon earth was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>founded? There were three possible methods of answering
the challenge of heresy. The first was reform, the
weeding out of those abuses which gave anti-sacerdotalism
its case and its opportunity, reform whereby
all might be enabled to recognize incontestably that
Christ was plainly revealed in the life of His Church.
The second was missionary propaganda, the utilization
of the same weapon which the enemy so trenchantly
wielded—that of persuasion. The third possible method
was constraint.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III - ‘THE EVERLASTING GOSPEL’</h3>

<p>In 1196 Pope Celestine III gave his sanction to a new
order, of which the mother-house was in Fiore. From
this place its founder derived his name, and he is generally
known as Joachim of Flora. Born of a noble family
and intended for a courtier, he had joined the Cistercians
in the desire for a life of austere discipline, but finding
its severities insufficient to satisfy his zeal had retired
into a hermitage, where however would-be disciples
sought him out, so that he had to put himself at their
head. Joachim, who has been described as ‘the founder
of modern mysticism,’<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> regarded himself as inspired, and
in his own life-time obtained the reputation of a prophet.
As a prophet he is recognized in Dante.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> There is no
question that Joachim was much under Greek influences.
Calabria itself, the scene of most of his labours, was half-Greek;
he paid more than one visit to Greece, came in
contact with the Greek Church and also almost certainly
with the Cathari, for Greece was a hotbed of their
doctrines. There is some common ground between
Catharism and the peculiar teachings with which the
name of Abbot Joachim is associated. Except for a
few unimportant pamphlets against the Jews and other
adversaries of the Christian faith there are only three
works of which he was the undoubted author—a concordance,
a psalter and a commentary on the book of
the Revelation. The authenticity of two epistles ascribed
to him is probable, but many other works put down to
his authorship after his death are certainly spurious.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>The contemporary reputation of Joachim would appear
to have been derived as much from his spoken utterances
as from his writings: but Adam Marsh prized the smallest
fragments of his works, sending them whenever he
could obtain them from Italy to Bishop Grosseteste.
On the other hand, however interesting and indeed
startling they may have been, they were not during their
author’s lifetime regarded as in any way injurious.
His reputation as a seer was wholly orthodox and unexceptionable.
In 1200 he submitted his books to the
Holy See for its approval, and the verdict was that they
were undoubtedly of divine inspiration. Thirteen years
later, indeed, certain speculations concerning the Trinity
in one of his minor tracts were condemned by the Council
of the Lateran. But the author was not personally condemned,
and his order was definitely approved; while
in 1220 Honorius III issued a bull declaring Joachim
to have been a good Catholic.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>It is doubtful if the name of Joachim of Flora would
ever have been of any more than very transitory importance
had it not been for the appearance in 1254 of
a work entitled ‘The Eternal Gospel,’ of which he was
stated to be the author. No book of that title figures
among the authentic works of Joachim, nor did he give
that name to any collection of them. It seems that the
book which appeared in Paris in 1254 consisted of
Joachim’s three principal works—which had none of
them been hitherto deemed heretical—with explanatory
notes and a lengthy and all-important introduction
(<i>Introductorius in Evangelium Aeternum</i>). It must have
been rather in the notes and introduction than in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>text that the heresy lay, in the interpretations put upon
Joachim’s apocalyptic effusions rather than in the
effusions themselves. The true author, therefore, of
the heresies associated with ‘The Everlasting Gospel’
would appear to be the commentator, not the originator.
The authorship of the introduction and the glosses was
early ascribed to one of two persons—to a certain
Gherardo da Borgo San Donnino by the contemporary
chronicler Salimbene, to John of Parma by the inquisitor
Eymeric in his ‘Directorium Inquisitorum,’ written
more than a century later. In any case the author was
a Franciscan.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> And between the conceptions contained
in ‘The Everlasting Gospel’ and the Franciscan Order,
it will be seen, there was a very close and a very significant
connection.</p>

<p>We may take it that the compiler of the work which
startled the world in 1254—whether it was Gherardo
or John of Parma—is to be regarded less as an expounder
of the teaching of Joachim of Flora than as an original
thinker, either honestly finding a preceptor and a kindred
soul in the prophet and simply elaborating his thesis,
or else utilizing the apocalyptic utterances of a man who
had died in the full odour of sanctity in order to build
up a thesis essentially his own on esoteric writings easily
susceptible of a new construction. It is sufficient that
‘The Everlasting Gospel’ has direct reference to that
section of the Franciscans which was at the time led by
John of Parma, and that in the new religion which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>work predicts the Friars are to play the leading part
as inaugurators. The work is indeed astoundingly
revolutionary. In much the same way that Mazzini in
his ‘From the Council to God’ proclaimed the emergence
of a new religion of Humanity superseding Christianity
did ‘The Everlasting Gospel’ proclaim a new religion,
that of the Holy Ghost. But whereas condemnation
of the Catholic Church was commonplace in the nineteenth
century and humanitarian ideas familiar; in
the thirteenth century it is rather astonishing to find
an admission that Christianity has failed and that a
new dispensation is necessary for the salvation of mankind.
The text of ‘The Everlasting Gospel’ is the
words in the book of the Revelation, ‘And I saw another
angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting
gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth,
and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and
people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give
glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come.’<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
Joachim had foretold in his ‘Concordia’ that the world
would go through three cycles, those of the Father or
the circumcision or the law; of the Son, crucifixion,
grace; of the Holy Ghost, peace and love. The first
had been the era of Judaism, of the Old Testament.
It had led on to that of the New Testament and the
Christian Church. The second period was very shortly to
reach its accomplishment, and the third and last era, that
of ‘The Everlasting Gospel,’ to be inaugurated by a new
religious order. By mystic computations the date of the
commencement of the final era was found to be 1260.</p>

<p>Fundamental to such a mystic conception of human
history is the assumption that Christianity is not the
whole and the sole truth, that it is not complete in itself,
but only a partial revelation of God to man, destined to
be superseded by a fuller, ampler revelation in the same
way in which it had superseded Judaism. Such an assumption
could only rest upon a pessimistic view of contemporary
life and society, a feeling that it urgently needed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>new saviour. Joachim strongly denounced the evils of his
day, especially those evinced by the Church, which was
given up to carnal appetites and neglected its duties,
to the advantage of proselytizing heresies, for which
it was thus itself indirectly responsible. The author
or authors of ‘The Everlasting Gospel’ illustrated this
very conception by elaborating a thesis really more
destructive of the Catholic faith than Catharism itself.
The ending of the second era was to be accompanied
by great tribulations, but these grievous troubles would
usher in the millennium, days of perfect justice, peace and
happiness, in which God would be worshipped everywhere
and in which the Eucharist and indeed all other
sacraments would be needless, mankind being liberated
from such burdens, so complete would be the knowledge
of God in the heart of the individual man. The conversion
of the world to this new dispensation, in which
each man would live the devoted life of a monk, was to
be brought about by the new mendicant order, in which
would be manifested all the highest powers of man.
What order could this be but the Franciscan?</p>

<p>The personality and career of St. Francis of Assisi
are of profound significance in the history of mediæval
Christianity. Their sanctity and spiritual power gave
other men, such as Peter Damiani, Bruno, Stephen
Harding, Norbert, Bernard, Dominic, a great reputation
and authority even in their own lifetime. But Francis
stood apart from and above all of them, even Bernard.
His intense sincerity, his absolute, unconditional renunciation
of all worldly things, the charm and beauty
of his character made the man, upon whose body the
στίγματα of Christ were said to have been seen, appear
to his own day as one different from all other men—indeed
so miraculously near to the spirit of his Master
as to be hailed by some even as a second Christ. Simple,
unlearned, not interested in intellectual matters, making
religion an inward matter of spiritual experience, intense
conviction of sin and of repentance together with unreserved
devotion of life and soul to God in personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
service, St. Francis was no organizer, and when the
nucleus of an order gathered round him viewed the
future with the utmost disquietude, fearing in the very
fact of organization a falling away from those ideas
of strictest poverty and personal holiness which marked
out the Minorites from all other religious associations.
Yet if the influence of St. Francis was to survive his
death, organization, whatever its drawbacks, was an
imperative necessity. This work was carried out by
a man of rare energy and constructive powers, Elias
of Cortona, with the active support of Gregory IX.
Elias did for the Franciscans what St. Paul did for
primitive Christianity. But between the spirit of Elias
and that of Francis there was a difference equivalent
to that between the zeal of a prophet and the skill of
a statesman. The Franciscan Order as it came to be,
if it gained something by its organization, lost also,
as the founder had foreseen. With organization there
came indeed recruitment from the ranks of scholarship,
and the followers of the unlearned saint of Assisi included
in Alexander of Hales, Bonaventura and Roger Bacon
men who could take stand with Albertus Magnus and
Thomas Aquinas himself among the followers of the
learned Dominic de Guzman. But there came also
with organization temporal influence and worldly wealth,
entirely out of harmony with the mind and ideals of
Francis, and proving indeed a snare and a temptation
to those very clerical abuses against which the whole
life of Francis had been a protest.</p>

<p>Accordingly, there came about a very serious and
indeed irreconcilable cleavage among the Grey Friars.
There were on the one side the followers of Elias who
came to be known as the Conventuals, arguing that a
strict compliance with the principles of Francis was
impracticable, indeed fanatical, that compromise involving
the abandonment of the mendicant ideal and
the acceptance of property was not only justifiable
but unavoidable for the continued existence of their
society. On the other side were the Spirituals, arguing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
that the policy of compromise meant nothing less than
the repudiation of the distinctive characteristics of
the order which had led to its creation and justified
its continuation, and urging to the full the strictest
conformity with all their uncompromising sincerity.
The dispute between the two parties had been some
years in progress when ‘The Everlasting Gospel’ was
published, the John of Parma to whom the authorship
of the work was by some attributed being at that time
General of the order and a most perfervid Spiritual.
St. Francis himself had indeed been orthodox enough,
for the most part accepting the articles of faith in a
spirit of unquestioning obedience, though the bent of
his mind and his marriage to the Lady Poverty caused
him to attach more importance to some dogmas than
to others, and in particular to shorten and to simplify all
forms and ritual. But in the beautiful fancifulness
of Francis there was a strong element of mysticism,
and this element was a marked characteristic of those
who sought to retain his ideal of asceticism in the order.
To such the mystical outpourings of the Abbot Joachim
made a powerful appeal. For they perceived in his
predictions a clear reference to themselves, found in
Francis the forerunner and in themselves, his true
followers, the destined preachers of the new era of the
Holy Ghost in which the carnal-mindedness of a decadent
Church and the corruption and indeed the worldliness
of the whole human race were to be known no more.
To some extremists Francis figured not as a great saint
and servant of Christ seeking to reclaim the world
to His truth, but as an equal with Christ—not as the
restorer of an existent religion, but as the creator of a
new religion. So completely heterodox a construction
was it possible to place upon the mission of St. Francis,
in the light of Joachite prophecy.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
<p>It can easily be understood that the taint of Joachitism
among the Spirituals gave a splendid opportunity
to their adversaries, which the latter were not slow
to take. The Pope, Alexander IV, was appealed to;
John of Parma was forced to resign, and his successor,
Bonaventura, who belonged to neither party, was made,
however unwillingly, to take action against John himself
and his most outstanding adherents. Already evidence
was accumulating of heretical dangers which might
accrue from the wedding together of Franciscan ideas of
poverty with Joachitic mysticism, and Spirituals began
to be looked upon askance. Already Languedoc,
abundant source of all manner of onslaughts upon the
faith, was beginning to welcome the ideas of Joachim, and
it was possible for the Conventuals to argue that their
opponents were no better than a heretical sect, another
form of Cathari. Later on there came successors to the
author of ‘The Everlasting Gospel,’ in the Franciscan
Pierre Jean Olivi in France, in Italy Arnaldo da Villanova,
who pronounced the vices of the clergy to be eloquent
signs of the presence of Antichrist.</p>

<p>To begin with the Spirituals were in the ascendant.
Bonaventura, in controversy with William of Saint Amour,
a virulent enemy of the whole Franciscan order,
maintained that poverty was an essential feature of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Christianity and that neither Christ Himself nor His
disciples owned property of any kind. Pope Nicholas III
by the bull <i>Exiit qui seminat</i> gave the sanction of the
Holy See to the view that St. Francis had been inspired
in his creation of the Rule by the Holy Ghost; that
Christ had completely renounced the ownership of
property and that such renunciation was most laudable
and Christian. At the same time he drew a distinction—no
new one, because it had already been put into practice
by Innocent IV and Alexander IV—between ownership
and use, and laid down as a rule always to be followed
that the ownership of Franciscan property was vested
in the Holy See, the Franciscans themselves simply
having the usufruct. This bull did not, as might have
been anticipated, settle the dispute between the two
Franciscan factions. Laxity increased among the Conventuals,
and Joachite tendencies still subsisted among
their opponents. The pontificate of Boniface VIII, which
began in 1294, brought upon the scene a man most
eminently practical, essentially worldly. To the Pope,
who had designs on the temporal power and eventually
announced categorically, ‘I am Caesar, I am Emperor,’
the ascetic ideal of the Spirituals was a ridiculous fanaticism,
which was also a positive nuisance. The mendicant
orders had been especially the servants of the papacy;
the Spirituals were apt to refer to it as Antichrist. Moreover,
the existence of wandering friars, actually beggars,
under no proper discipline and supervision—as some of
the Spirituals had become—outraged his sense of order
and decency. Boniface decided that these lawless bands
must be hunted down, and utilized the Inquisition for
this purpose. Under Clement V the lot of the Spirituals
considerably improved, and inveighing against the abuses
of their false brethren they very nearly succeeded in
securing a permanent separation into an order of their
own. Instead of this Clement, while declaring in favour
of the ascetic party and favouring them generally during
his pontificate, endeavoured to induce the rival factions
to drop their quarrels and live together in amity. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
efforts at settlement were defeated by the action of
Spirituals in Italy, who at the very time when a Council
at Vienne, sitting in 1311-12, was declaring in favour
of the Spirituals and prohibiting their enemies from
referring to them as heretics, proclaimed themselves a
separate community and brought down the Pope’s
wrath upon them as rebels and schismatics and indeed
founders of a pestilential sect.</p>

<p>The controversy came to a head under Clement’s
successor, the resolute and aggressive John XXII, to
whom the pauper ideal was particularly obnoxious. He
was extremely avaricious and full of worldly ambitions
which involved him in frequent wars in Italy. This
pontiff—possessing in his nature not one single feature
in common with St. Francis—determined on restoring
order within the Franciscan fold and bringing the
Spirituals to obedience.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> The first attack on the ascetic
party was made in Languedoc. One of the minor distinctive
features of the Spirituals was their wearing
smaller gowns and hoods than the Conventuals. The
Spirituals in the province of Aquitaine, in Béziers,
Narbonne and Carcassonne, were forbidden to wear this
distinctive garb. Twenty-five, to whom the wearing of
their habit was symbolical of the whole principle for
which they stood, refused to submit and were delivered
to the Inquisition at Marseilles. Already the Pope had
declared that all the wandering Spirituals in Languedoc
who styled themselves <i>Fratres de paupere vita</i> or <i>Fraticelli</i>
were heretics, and had stated very significantly
in the bull <i>Quorundam</i> that however praiseworthy
poverty might be, more praiseworthy was obedience.
Four of the twenty-five remained obdurate to the
last, were handed over to the secular arm, and burnt.
This proved to be but the beginning of a persecution
carried out most rigorously by means of the Holy Office,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>particularly in the south of France, but also in Spain
and Italy.</p>

<p>The rebel Franciscans were persecuted because they
were heretical, and it is important to note in what their
heresy consisted. It was not because of Joachite
tendencies—these might or might not exist, they were
not a criterion—it was because of disobedience pure
and simple. To disobey the constitution <i>Quorundam</i>,
to dispute its ruling as to the wearing of a habit and
the question of ownership of property—that was heresy.
It is true that the motive which induced the recalcitrant
to refuse obedience to the bull was a repudiation of papal
authority to lay down such a regulation regarding the
Franciscan Rule, and that such repudiation was connected
with Joachite views as to the degeneracy of the Church
and the unique reforming rôle of the Franciscan order.
None the less the fact remained that in running directly
counter to the ruling of the bull <i>Exiit qui seminat</i> and
the decisions of the Council of Vienne John XXII had
actually created a new heresy, had asserted that what
had seemed most Christian and laudable to Nicholas III
and Clement V was an error in the faith. The persecution
had the result of actually encouraging Joachitism. ‘As
well to be hanged for a sheep as a lamb’ is a proverb
of very general validity. If it was heresy to disobey a
papal bull—granted that that <i>had</i> to be disobeyed—why
not go to the full length of rejecting the papacy
and declaring it superseded by the era of St. Francis and
the Holy Ghost? The papal pronouncement made the
fanatical Spirituals more and more convinced that the
Roman Church was indeed ‘the whore of Babylon,’ the
Pope veritable Antichrist. And certainly we may regard
the extremists latterly, under the goad of persecution,
as having developed into a sect, definitely believing itself
to be the true Church—that of St. Francis and the Holy
Ghost. But such fanatical Spirituals were exceedingly
small in numbers, their influence very restricted, and
their extinction was brought about without very much
difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was not only the extremists that were made
victims. On November 12, 1323, John XXII, to whom
the Spirituals’ conception of the place of poverty in the
Christian Church was definitely anathema, so irreconcilable
was it with his papal policy, issued the bull, <i>Cum
inter nonnullos</i>, in which it was authoritatively denied
that Christ and His Apostles possessed no property.
To assert that they held none was error and heresy.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>
This question of dogma became involved with secular
politics, when Lewis of Bavaria, being claimant to the
imperial crown and at enmity with Pope John, found it
convenient to adopt the cause of the Franciscans and to
denounce the Pope himself as a heretic for not believing
in the absolute poverty of Christ, as he did in a formal
indictment of John known as the Protest of Sachsenhausen.
A controversy between Empire and Papacy was
thus started which is of great interest because it evoked
the ‘Defensor Pacis’ of Marsiglio of Padua and the
numerous polemical works of William of Ockham on
the imperial side. This controversy is of much greater
interest and significance than the story of the persecutions
of the <i>Fratres de paupere vita</i>, or <i>Fraticelli</i>, which continued
as the result of John XXII’s action, more especially
in Italy, into the later decades of the fourteenth century.
The significance of the persecutions lies in the virtual
creation of a heresy by a papal bull. That it should be
possible for any individual wearer of the papal tiara to
declare heretical what his predecessors had held to be
praiseworthy and to stigmatize as heretics his opponents
in secular politics revealed a great danger. To hold fast
to an immutable faith is easy, but what if the immutable
faith does as a matter of fact change! The bull <i>Cum
inter nonnullos</i> made it possible that a man might be
condemned as a heretic because he held a certain view
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>as to Christ’s poverty, although perfectly able and willing
to subscribe to every article in the Christian creed
as defined in the great councils of the early Church.
Catharism may have been a real peril to the Church;
but to maintain that men who had no other wish but to
preserve the strict Rule of St. Francis in the order constituted
such a peril is impossible. And men might well
be bewildered by the fact that whereas the revolutionary
teachings of Joachitism were not at first proscribed, the
wearing of a particular type of hood became heretical
not many years later.</p>

<p>The importance of ‘The Everlasting Gospel’ lies
principally in its influence on the Franciscan order, but
it had several other developments which are of distinct
interest as remarkable illustrations of the strange
fanaticisms and superstitious credulities possible in the
thirteenth century. The Joachite idea of a new era and
new religion led to the astonishing discovery of incarnations
of the divine. One was found in a certain woman,
a native of Milan, called Guglielma, who seemed to have
been in no way remarkable save for her piety.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> Yet the
little band of followers who gathered round her came
to venerate her as a saint and a miracle worker. The
biographies of mediæval worthies are full of tales of the
miraculous, and there was nothing strange in this. But
the extraordinary absurdity followed of finding her to
be the Holy Ghost in female form. The woman herself
never countenanced such fantastic ideas and expressly
repudiated any supernatural powers. But after her
death a small circle of fanatic devotees established her
worship in Milan with a certain Maifreda at their head,
performing high sacerdotal functions and destined in
the eyes of her associates to succeed to the papal
throne when the corrupt Roman Church should have
passed away.</p>

<p>The Guglielmites were a very insignificant sect,
easily extinguished. Potentially more dangerous were
the followers of one Gherardo Segarelli, a very ignorant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>and very demented enthusiast of Parma, who, being
rejected on his seeking admission into the Franciscan
order, determined to outdo St. Francis in the exact
reproduction of the life of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> His method of
accomplishing this purpose was to have himself circumcised,
wrapped in swaddling clothes and suckled by a
woman—after which preliminaries he stalked into the
streets of his native town, a wild, uncouth figure, calling
all men to repentance. In time the madman succeeded
in attracting devotees from among herdsmen as ignorant
and almost as foolish as himself. The movement began
to be formidable when it spread beyond Parma, even
beyond Italy, being found in 1287 in Germany; and
it appeared that Segarelli aimed at proselytizing the
world. The papacy was roused, the Inquisition put
into action, Segarelli himself in 1300 burnt in Parma,
his disciples, known as Apostolic Brethren, energetically
persecuted.</p>

<p>They were not, however, entirely eradicated. Some
remained—men of more intellect than the lunatic
heresiarch and his half-witted herdsmen—and among
them a certain Fra Dolcino, who saw in the appearance
of Segarelli in the all-fateful year 1260 a fulfilment of
the prophecies in ‘The Everlasting Gospel.’<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> He chose
to regard himself as a heaven-appointed messenger of
the new dispensation. As fanatical as Segarelli himself,
he was more dangerous because apparently gifted with
the capacity of leadership and of inspiring even enthusiastic
loyalty. Beginning in Milan, Bergamo, Brescia,
Vercelli, he had by 1304 created a distinct religious
community among the Italian Alps. It appears that
in order to maintain their supplies of provisions they
were wont to resort to robbery, and must have become
a public nuisance. But they were also dangerous
heretics; it is a remarkable tribute to the mark made
by Dolcino’s personality that Dante makes Mohammed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>send a warning message to Dolcino, as to a kindred false
prophet, lest he fall into the same ill-case as himself.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
In June, 1305, Clement V resolved upon drastic measures
to wipe out this ‘son of Belial who had been polluting
Lombardy.’<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> A crusade was organized against the
Dolcinists in their mountain fastnesses, and after a
desperate defence against no fewer than four different
expeditions, in which there was much bloodshed and
ferocity and in which the heretics were so reduced as to
have recourse to cannibalism, they were forced to surrender.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>
The punishment of Dolcino—for the nature of
which, it should be remembered, the state and in no
way the Inquisition was responsible—was terrible in the
extreme. He was gradually torn to pieces by red-hot
pincers—an appalling torment which he bore with an
almost incredible fortitude.</p>

<p>Indirectly connected with the ascetic and mendicant
enthusiasm of the Spiritual Franciscans were certain
heretical movements in Germany—those of the Beghards
or Beguines. The names are used somewhat indiscriminately
to denote Fraticelli, who were simply
wandering Spirituals asserting the supreme virtues of
poverty, and other sectaries, much more extravagant,
whose only likeness to the Spirituals lay in their
mendicancy. The indiscriminacy of nomenclature undoubtedly
denotes a very comprehensible failure at times
to distinguish between vagrants outwardly alike and all
of them at least under the suspicion of heretical tendencies.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
Among the extravagants to whom this title
was given were followers of two teachers of a crude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>mysticism and pantheism—one Amaury de Bène,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> whose
doctrine had a very marked antinomian tinge, for he
maintained that no one filled with the Holy Ghost and
the spirit of love could commit sin; the other, Ortlieb
of Strassburg, whose pantheism caused him to include
Satan in the divine essence, so that his followers, generally
known as Brethren of the Free Spirit, were also sometimes
known as Luciferans and credited with devil-worship and
the perpetration of the most disgusting obscenities at the
initiation of novices into the faith. The Brethren of the
Free Spirit were never numerous, but in spite of constant
persecution they appear to have existed right up to the
days of Lutheranism. Their doctrines were not without
significance, because together with an exalted claim to impeccability
which prescribed the severest tests of sexual
purity they combined a mystic belief, which under
the term Illuminism, a name they themselves adopted,
had a considerable influence on the theological thought
of Germany. The most remarkable of these was the
distinguished Dominican, Master Eckhart, who appears
to have maintained that man shared the divinity of
God and that in the eyes of God virtue and sin
were alike.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>The existence of such venturesome pantheistic speculations
as these broad-cast in Germany reacted very
unfavourably on all unrecognized, and particularly on
migratory, religious associations, which became involved
in the persecutions set on foot in consequence of the
undoubted heresies of the pantheists. Such associations
tended to increase in the thirteenth century. They
were not necessarily connected with the Spiritual Franciscans
or Fraticelli; but they certainly owed their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>origin to the popularity of the mendicant idea as practised
by the friars, in particular the Minorites. They are
found in France, Germany, Italy and the Low Countries;
and to such voluntary fellowships there could be no
legitimate objection in themselves; they might be the
most laudable instruments for the exploitation of
religious zeal. Only they called for thorough supervision.
Beguinages, therefore—large permanent houses—were
established in such towns as Cologne, Ghent, and
Paris, such establishments being under careful management,
the special protection of the popes and secular
princes, and enjoying often the highest reputation for
sanctity. But with wanderers it was different. They
could not be supervised, and to distinguish between the
orthodox and the schismatic mendicant was difficult.
Undisciplined vagrancy was in itself an invitation to
temptation. The Inquisition in Germany represented
to Boniface IX in 1396 that for a hundred years all
manner of heresies had lurked under the outward fair-seeming
of the Beghards and that their suppression was
impeded by certain papal constitutions urged in their
protection.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> It is true that at times, owing to the extent
to which the innocent were wont to suffer with the guilty,
the papacy had ere that come to the rescue of the former,
as for example Benedict XIV in 1336 and Gregory XI
in 1374. It had in particular been necessary to protect
women, large numbers of whom joined themselves not
only to the permanent mendicant communities, but to
the wandering mendicants. In times that were hard
and wild and disordered, when there was no system of
poor-relief save through the Church, the lot of widows
and of women and girls who had no male protectors
was exceedingly hard, and for such the mendicant
associations had a clear attraction as a means of asylum
and refuge. The war upon the Beghards in many cases
led to many respectable women being led into a life
of misery and want and sometimes prostitution, until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Benedict XIV intervened on their behalf.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> At the
Council of Constance certain rules were drawn up for
the regulation of beguinages, but beguines did not thereby
escape persecution. In 1431 we find Eugenius IV intervening
for their protection. Ever in danger of persecution,
wanderers over the face of the land, these mendicant
communities, whether remaining within the Church’s
fold or not, were a source of religious unrest, of
dissatisfaction with the hierarchy, of aspiration for
new doctrines which would attune with the intense
individualism of a mystic illuminism. By such men
and women Lutheranism might well be welcomed and
its progress materially assisted.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>One of the strangest of the fanatical outbursts of
the Middle Ages, especially in Germany, is indirectly
connected with the Brethren of the Free Spirit, some
of whom joined themselves with the Flagellants. The
latter first made their appearance in Europe in 1259
in Italy, whence the movement spread to Bohemia and
Germany. A more important outbreak occurred in
the middle of the next century, when the appalling
ravages of the Black Death had no doubt brought home
to many thousands of the survivors the awful fragility
and insecurity of human life and the need for repentance
and godliness. It was the consciousness of the impotence
of man probably that gave popularity to the
abasement and self-torture of the scourge. There was
a positive luxury of misery in the suggestion of so drastic
a means of grace for a polluted people, smitten by the
heavy hand of an angry God. Through Hungary,
Germany, Flanders, Holland marched these penitents,
proclaiming complete regeneration for all who should
persevere in flagellation for thirty-three days and a
half, chanting weird prayers in which this creed was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>enshrined.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> Theirs was a new gospel—the all-sufficient
efficacy of the voluntary effusion of blood.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>It is no wonder that the authorities became alarmed.
Legitimate exception was taken to the enthusiasts’ indecency—men
went virtually naked, women insufficiently
clad, all were under a temptation to sexual excesses.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>
Worse was the doctrinal error involved—the attack upon
sacraments and priesthood contained in the preaching
of the strange means of grace by these new priests
of Baal.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> In 1349 Clement VI, condemning the movement
on the ground of the contempt of the Church
implied in the formation of such an unlicensed fellowship,
ordered the suppression of the Flagellants, who
thereafter came under the purview of the Inquisition.
The heretical doctrine inherent in the Flagellant mania
was enunciated in its most extravagant form by a native
of Thuringia, named Conrad Schmidt, who in 1414
was maintaining that all spiritual authority had passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>from the Catholic Church to the Flagellants, that not
only were the sacraments useless, but they had been
proscribed by God and it was mortal sin to partake of
them, so that, for example, the ceremony of marriage
polluted the union.</p>

<p>The fundamentally anti-sacerdotal character of the
Flagellant movement was shared by another contemporary
mania in Flanders and the Rhinelands—a
dancing mania, under whose impulse fanatics would
leap and convulse themselves in the most violent contortions
in fierce ecstasies of religious frenzy.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>It is a most curious and remarkable story that is
made by these interconnected heresies, more especially
of the thirteenth century, and by others like them. In
the midst of the Ages of Faith individual emotional
outpourings or intellectual speculations would lead to
strange results of fanaticism or dogma. There were
indeed some that were mainly sensual in origin, but
others betokened an earnest desire for a new heaven
and a new earth and demanded a moral progression in
human affairs not visible in existing human society.
Such an aspiration is implicit in all the strange theories
connected with ‘The Everlasting Gospel’ and in all
the ideas of the Spiritual Franciscans, their offshoots
and their companion sects. How much of such aspiration,
such opinions could the mediæval Church absorb
within herself? It was ever doubtful. It would have
been impossible to predict beforehand upon which side
would eventually be found many of the remarkable
men referred to in this chapter—Francis, John of Parma,
Bonaventura, Marsiglio of Padua, William of Ockham,
Roger Bacon, Amaury, Master Eckhart. The pope
who condemned the Spiritual Franciscans might easily
have regarded Francis himself as a heretic. Fortunately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>for herself the Church, while repudiating doctrines
which were obviously unchristian, those that were the
mere frenzies of the ignorant and the demented, succeeded
in absorbing a large measure of the enthusiasm
and the thought of the age, incorporated the mendicant
orders, produced the scholastic philosophy. Nevertheless
there were abroad in the mediæval world moral
and intellectual ferments, yearnings for regeneration
and guesses at truth which found within her fold no
satisfaction.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV - AVERRHOÏST INFLUENCES</h3>

<p>The great intellectual achievement of the Middle Ages
was the recovery of the learning of the world that had
vanished before the onset of the Hun, the Vandal and
the Lombard.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> That learning was in part classical,
in part patristic. But as the process of absorption
was the achievement of the Church, the emphasis was
on theology, and the works of the Fathers bulked very
much more largely than the profane literatures of Greece
and Rome. There was much in the teaching of Augustine
that was Neoplatonic, that was akin to the speculations
of Plato himself. But the whole point of view, method
and cast of mind of the mediæval thinker were radically
different from those of the pagan philosopher. The
latter set out upon the search for abstract truth without
any preconceptions; the former started from the postulate
of a divine revelation. His primary object was not
to investigate, but to justify the ways of God to man.
For him all knowledge must be a theodicæa. He was
not, therefore, an original thinker; for the foundations
of his scholarship being revealed truth, his most
marked characteristic was a sincere deference to
authority. He was, moreover, ever conscious that the
salvation of the soul was a matter of greater cogency
than even the exposition of God’s dealings with the
world. At the same time mediæval philosophy was
of a peculiarly formal pattern; and to the modern
world it is apt to appear pedantic indeed, ‘cabined,
cribbed, confined.’ It rested upon the tripod of grammar,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>rhetoric, logic. It was a matter very largely of dialectic,
and it may seem to us of mere verbal juggling. The
<i>Trivium</i> was an introduction to metaphysics, but the
metaphysics were strongly theological in bias and nakedly
logical in form. Their clue to the processes of thought
being logic, not psychology, mediæval thinkers did
not clearly distinguish between problems of the human
mind and problems of reality, assuming an exact correspondence
between mental conceptions and the ultimate
facts of the universe.</p>

<p>Yet whatever the defects of the scholastic philosophy,
it holds a great and significant place in the history of
the intellectual development of western Europe, since
it was the means whereby the learning of the ancient
world was recovered and preserved and an intellectual
continuity rendered possible. Such is one out of many
of the great contributions made by the mediæval Church
to the cause of civilization. Secular knowledge was not
proscribed, but on the contrary adopted and utilized, by
the Church; enquiry and research not looked askance
upon, but encouraged. The universities of the Middle
Ages were ecclesiastical in origin; their teachers and
scholars were clerks. The great University of Paris,
the very centre of the intellectual life of Christendom
in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, was an object
of very special solicitude to the Holy See. The two
great mendicant orders, the Prædicants and the
Minorites, taking the lead in the schools and universities
only a few years after their own inception, speedily produced
some of the most erudite and the most brilliant
minds of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century the leading scholastics were
Augustinians; in the middle of the thirteenth the
dominant philosophy was still of a Neoplatonic character.
The great Franciscans Alexander of Hales, Bonaventura,
Peckham belonged to that school of thought. In many
of them, notably in Bonaventura, there was a marked
strain of mysticism. The mystic note in Plato, his
insistence on moral and spiritual values had made his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
doctrine harmonize easily with Christian dogma. The
appropriation of pagan thought and secular science had
not so far produced any discord with the truths of the
Christian faith, or any serious tendency to question
them. It is indeed significant that the pupils of Anselm
of Bec should have asked him for a <i>rational</i> justification
of Christian dogma; but that had not betokened any
doubt as to the possibility of reconciling faith with
reason, but only an appreciation of the desirability
of being able to demonstrate that, however superfluous,
such justification was perfectly possible. Again, in
the vast compendious treatises of such encyclopædic
scholars as Vincent of Beauvais, Hugo of St. Victor
and Peter Lombard, there was the explicit recognition
that, while secular learning is a thing to be desired for
its own sake, yet its stages of <i>cogitatio</i> and <i>meditatio</i>
are only the threshold before the portal of the shrine,
wherein the divine nature may be contemplated. Reason
cannot unaided explain the ineffable; the visible world
is but the <i>simulacrum</i> of the unseen.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> Once or twice
indeed there had been hints of danger. Right back
in the ninth century a certain very self-confident Irishman,
by name John Scotus Eriugena, had declared
the supremacy of reason over authority; for while
authority sometimes proceeded from reason, reason
never proceeded from authority. In the eleventh
century there had been the aberrations of Berengar
of Tours and Roscellinus. In the next century a new
and more brilliant Eriugena arose in the person of
Abelard, a man even more self-opinionated and self-confident,
one who treated the seeming contradictions
of the Fathers as opportunity merely for mental
calisthenics, whose whole method of thought appeared
to enthrone reason at the expense of authority. But
the potential danger was never realized. The trained
dialectician trembled before the unlearned spiritual
dictator of Christendom; the man who exalted himself
in his own eyes dared not face Bernard, to whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
God was all in all and man as nothing: and at the last
Abelard, a monk of Cluny, died humbled, in the odour
of sanctity. Up to the end of the twelfth century,
then, the free play of enquiry and discussion in the
schools had not threatened defilement of the purity
of the Christian faith. Heresy had indeed been a
serious danger; but not among the learned, not in the
precincts of the university, had it been bred.</p>

<p>The succeeding century, however, did bring with
it an anxious problem. There came a large influx of
new learning out of the pagan past—the encyclopædic
knowledge of Aristotle. Aristotle had been introduced
into the world of Latin Christianity long ere this through
the medium of Boëthius in the days of Theodoric.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
The Dark Ages had intervened since then. Now came
a second and a much more significant advent of Aristotle.
This time he came through a non-Christian medium,
through the interpretations of the ‘great commentator,’
the Moslem Ibn-Roschd, Averrhoës. Could the
Stagirite be won for Christ; could his teachings be
enlisted for the Christian theodicæa? The Church
could not but be alive to the risks involved in any converse
with Aristotelianism. There were radical contrasts
between the Platonic and Aristotelian methods. The
latter was inductive, non-committal, denoted an impartial
examination of natural phenomena, the range
of which was infinitely more comprehensive than anything
which any other human mind had ever attempted.
Aristotle seemed intent rather upon coldly collecting
evidence from the operations of a soulless Nature than
extolling the wonders of God in a beatific vision. The
extent of secular knowledge opened up in the writings
of Aristotle was, then, vast and their attraction to
the alert and curious mind correspondingly vivid;
but the attractiveness had to be viewed with caution.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p>The Church perceived that there were in the Peripatetic
philosophy elements which must be repugnant to truly
devout minds. This would have been true even had
the pure unadulterated text of Aristotle been in question;
it was the more cogently true seeing that Aristotle was
presented to the Christian world through the voice of
Averrhoës and the commentary was more familiar
than the original.</p>

<p>During the tenth and eleventh centuries when
Christendom was for the most part wrapped in a barbarous
ignorance, Saracen culture, in the caliphates of Baghdad
and Cordova, had kept alive the sciences—mathematics,
astronomy, medicine—and speculative thinkers had
preserved, not indeed uncorrupted, yet always as a
vital influence, the ancient philosophy of Greece, when
to the Christian world it was lost in oblivion. Side by
side with an orthodox philosophy in consonance with
the teachings of the Koran, Islam had produced a heretic
philosophy, which though written in a Semitic language
and modified by an oriental environment, was essentially
Greek, essentially Aristotelian.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> To the Arabian thinkers
the Stagirite represented the utmost limit of the human
intelligence; they could not conceive that there could
ever be improvement upon knowledge so Catholic,
synthesis so complete.</p>

<p>The first of the great Arabian philosophers, Alfarabi,
had been Neoplatonist in thought, Aristotelian in
method.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> His great successor, Avicenna, was Aristotelian
both in the content and the logical scheme of his
work.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> The distinctive teachings of Avicenna were,
first, the nominalist doctrine that universality exists
not in reality, but in thought only; secondly, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>matter is uncreated and eternal; thirdly, that the first
and only direct emanation from God or the First Cause
is Intelligence, νοῦς, but that this communication of
intelligence to lesser beings is not a single act in time,
but a constant process or an everlasting act. While in
the eastern caliphate these bold speculations were
strongly denounced by the later philosopher of Baghdad,
Ghazali, and were repudiated in a powerful orthodox
reaction;<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> in Spain at the beginning of the twelfth
century Avempace and Abubacer were teaching that
the life of the soul is a progress from a purely instinctive
existence shared with the lower animals to a spiritual
absorption in the divine essence and intellect; while
the latter philosopher added the contention that religious
creeds were but types of, or approximations to, absolute
truth, which the philosopher, but never the mere theologian,
may attain. The greatest of all the Arabian
thinkers, Averrhoës, whose life extended over the greater
part of the twelfth century was, in even greater degree
than Avicenna, a worshipper of Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> While
Avicenna occasionally questioned his great original,
Averrhoës never did. He laid no claim to originality.
To him the substance of human wisdom could never
alter, being enshrined for ever in Aristotle’s pages. If
Averrhoïsm differs from Aristotelianism, it does not
differ consciously. Averrhoïsm is simply and solely
the undiluted gospel of Aristotle, as Averrhoës conceived
it.</p>

<p>Its principal theses—the Averrhoïst version of
Aristotle—are the eternity of matter and the unity of
the intellect.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> Matter is uncreated. God did not create;
He is Himself the primordial element in things, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>latent force or impulse in the universe, which gives
it both its being and continuance. Emanating from
the First Cause is the <i>active</i> intellect. For Averrhoës
makes an important distinction between νοῦς ποιητικός
and νοῦς ποθητικός, the latter being the human
intellect. Averrhoës explains the difference by the
analogy of the sun and the human vision. Just as by
the light which it sheds the sun produces the capacity
to see, so the active intellect produces the capacity to
understand. But the human intellect has no individual
immortality, being at death absorbed in the universal
mind. Man, indeed, possesses no personal immortality.
Only in man’s power of reproducing his species can
there be said to be any human immortality. The
human race is permanent. In the fullest sense, however,
only the active intellect is eternal.</p>

<p>The attitude of Averrhoës to Islam, and indeed
to all religion, is important. It may be summed up by
saying that he was the friend of religion, the enemy
of theology, for which he could see no excuse. There
could be no compromise between faith and philosophy.
The theologian was at the outset hopelessly hampered
in the search for truth, because he had to premise all
the articles of his creed. His system, thus conditioned,
became a mere hodge-podge of sophistic quibblings,
groundless distinctions, fanciful allegories, which did
but serve to obscure and distort the religion which it
pretended to expound. The sincere and exact thinker
could accept no such postulates, start with no preconceptions.
Philosophy and religion must be kept completely
apart; the attempt to suffuse them—made
in theology—did but corrupt both. They were not,
however, mutually subversive. Religion was no branch
of knowledge, no matter of arid formularies; it was
an inward power, an inspiration. It was indispensable,
because it was the basis of morality for the multitude
who could not aspire to philosophy. But while Averrhoës
thus discountenanced any attempt to instil religious
doubts into the popular mind, his attitude towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
religion was exclusively utilitarian, and he obviously
regarded it as the inferior of philosophy. The special
religion of philosophers, he declared, was to study
what exists, for the noblest worship of God was in the
contemplation of his works. Philosophy, in short, the
pursuit of wisdom, was the highest form of religion,
higher than that which is based upon prophecy.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>Averrhoïsm speedily penetrated into Christendom.
Aragon and Castile naturally received it early. In
Languedoc, at the schools of Montpellier, Narbonne,
Perpignan, Arabian medicine and philosophy both
flourished. Scholars from central and western Europe,
visiting the medical schools of the Moors, no doubt
brought back with them the current views of the Saracen
philosopher as well as the Saracen physician. The
first Latin version of Averrhoës’ commentaries is attributed
to Michael Scot, who came fresh from Toledo
to the court of Frederick II; while there is a tradition
that the son of Averrhoës lived for a time in the palace
of that most eclectic potentate.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> From Saracen Toledo
itself, from Christians and Jews in Spain and Provence,
came translations of Averrhoës. It was probably with
extraordinary rapidity that the ideas of the Arabian
philosopher became the common property of the
Christian schoolmen.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Quite certainly Latin Averrhoïsm
was a force to be reckoned with by the middle of the
thirteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>The Averrhoïst was not the only Latin version of
Aristotle current in western Christendom in the twelfth
century. The capture of Constantinople by the crusaders
in 1204 had brought Catholic Europe directly into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>contact with Greek philosophy, and translations direct
from the Greek into Latin had been attempted, one
of the earliest being made by Bishop Grosseteste.
Various translations of Aristotle were, then, available.
Were they to be regarded as open without restriction
to the curious eye of scholarship? The Church decided
against such freedom. In 1210 a council of the ecclesiastical
province of Sens, held at Paris, having publicly
condemned the heresies of Amaury de Bène, went on
to protect the unwary from another source of possible
contamination by commanding that neither the works
of Aristotle nor the commentaries upon him should
be read in Paris under pain of excommunication.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> The
commentaries referred to must be either those of
Averrhoës or similar Arabian treatises. In 1215 this prohibition
was renewed by the papal legate, under whose
supervision the schools of Paris came. Gregory IX, in
a regulation addressed to the masters and students
of Paris on April 13, 1231, made the prohibition provisional,
until such time as the books of Aristotle could
be examined and expurgated. At the same time he
entrusted this important task to William of Auxerre
and two others. The project is very much to the credit
of the Pope, a genuine supporter of learning who, however,
had probably not realized how great an undertaking
it was. At all events it came to nothing; and the
prohibition, although renewed by Urban IV, in January
1263, would appear to have remained a dead-letter.
In 1255 the ‘Physics’ and ‘Metaphysics’ of Aristotle
were prescribed for the course in the Arts’ faculty in
the University. In fact the Aristotelian impulse in
the vivid and vigorous atmosphere of the youthful
Parisian schools was too strong. Neither Aristotle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>nor Averrhoës could be got rid of by papal inhibition.
The keenest interest had been aroused in them. It
were better, as it was simpler, to utilize such keenness
rather than to attempt to combat it. Of all the great
services rendered to the Church by the Dominican
order none was greater than its capture of profane
learning for orthodox Christianity. The great
Franciscans were expounding the current theology of
the day with its tinge of Platonism; the Dominicans
now came forward to adapt Aristotle for the service
of Christianity. In 1256 Alexander IV commissioned
Albertus Magnus to write his ‘De unitate intellectus
contra Averroëm’: a fact that is proof positive of the
headway that had already been made not only by
Aristotelianism but by the tenets of the ‘great commentator.’
The tractate is indeed written against
Averrhoës himself, not Averrhoïsts, but the fact that
the Pope entrusted Albert of Cologne with the task of
answering the former is evidence of the activity of the
latter.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> Fifteen years later Thomas Aquinas produced
another work on the same subject: but this one definitely
‘contra Averroïstas.’ Between the years 1261 and
1269 Aquinas was, together with William of Moerbeke,
at the court of Rome engaged upon the great task, now
at length undertaken under the auspices of the Holy
See, of making a translation and commentary on
Aristotle. In the latter year he appeared at Paris on
the occasion of the assembly there of a chapter-general
of the Dominican order. It has been maintained that
the real reason of his presence was to clear the Prædicants
of the suspicion of Averrhoïsm.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>The middle and the latter half of the thirteenth century
were years of violent controversy in the University
of Paris. Fundamentally the source of this was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>jealousy of the secular clergy against the Mendicant
orders, which had succeeded in establishing themselves
in the University earlier in the century, the Dominicans
securing their first chair in 1217, the Franciscans theirs
in 1219. Apprehensive lest the Friars should achieve a
complete predominance, the seculars under the leadership
of Gerard of Abbeville and the acrimonious William of
Saint-Amour led a heated attack upon them, first only
on the practical question of university privileges. But
it was not long before matters of doctrine were involved,
and regulars and seculars were soon denouncing each
other as heretics and antichrist.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> It is not easy to
discover what was the doctrinal position of the seculars,
but they seem to have reproached the Dominicans at all
events with overfondness for philosophy as distinct
from theology.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> Together with the contest between
seculars and regulars in the University there went also
one between the two great Mendicant orders. The
same charge seems to have been preferred against the
Prædicants by their rivals. They cared too much for
knowledge that was not wholly sacred; they were too
scientific, too intellectualist.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> Such is the gist of the
diatribes launched against the Dominicans, especially
Thomas Aquinas, by Archbishop Peckham.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> There is
no doubt that he deliberately tried to involve Aquinas
in the suspicion of Averrhoïsm. A certain Gilles de
Lessines, sending to Albertus Magnus a list of fifteen
errors current in Paris, includes in the number thirteen
definitely Averrhoïst doctrines together with two theories
of Aquinas, not Averrhoïst, to which, however, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Augustinians took exception.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> Clearly the Franciscans
were endeavouring to discredit not only the Averrhoïsts,
but the Aristotelians. In the year 1270 there appeared
two important treatises: the one by a certain Siger of
Brabant, entitled ‘De anima intellectiva,’ the other by
Aquinas, ‘De unitate intellectus contra Averroïstas.’
The latter is defending himself vigorously against the
charge of Averrhoïsm by himself vigorously attacking
the Averrhoïsts. In a sermon preached before the
University of Paris St. Thomas vehemently denounced
the self-confidence and self-sufficiency of the Averrhoïsts,
and contrasted the contradictions and the uncertainties
of philosophy with the clearness and certitude of revealed
religion.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> In this same year 1270 the Bishop of Paris,
Etienne Tempier, solemnly condemned the thirteen
propositions mentioned in Gilles de Lessines’ letter to
Albertus of Cologne. They were the doctrines being
taught at the time by the two leaders of Averrhoïsm
in the University, the Siger of Brabant just mentioned
and Boëthius of Dacia.</p>

<p>Of Siger’s works a number are extant. Two or three
are concerned with the sort of logical conundrums popular
among mediæval dialecticians or with theories of Aquinas
and are orthodox enough, but the ‘De aeternitate mundi’
and the ‘De anima intellectiva’ contain the whole gospel
of Averrhoës.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> Their contentions are so completely a
transcription of the ‘great commentator’ that it is
unnecessary to do more than summarize them briefly.
For Siger, as for the Arabian, Aristotle is the one and
only philosopher. Like Averrhöes too, Siger makes
no attempt to reconcile Aristotle with revealed religion,
but carries his teaching to its supposed logical conclusion.
Both Albertus and Aquinas, Siger maintained, had
perverted Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> Not they, but Averrhoës, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>the true exponent of the Stagirite. He proclaimed, then,
in all boldness the doctrine of the unity of the intellect
together with its inevitable corollary, the denial of personal
immortality; the doctrine of the eternity of matter,
which involved the negation of the Biblical story of
creation, the intervention of providence, the free will and
moral responsibility of the individual.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>Such were the fundamental conceptions of Siger’s
teaching and of the propositions condemned by the Bishop
of Paris in 1270. The condemnation did not silence the
Averrhoïst champion and his friends. For six or seven
more years they continued to be possibly a small, but
apparently an energetic and defiant, body among the
masters of arts in the University. Between 1272 and
1275 Siger was in open revolt against the authority of the
rector, Amaury of Rheims. The Averrhoïsts separated
themselves from the rest of the faculty; but the force
and skill, perhaps the very audacity, of their leader
attracted a large number of students to his lectures.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>
The doctrinal controversy continued. It was one not
so much concerning the truth or erroneousness of the
Averrhoïst position as on the question of fact—was
Averrhoës or Aquinas the more faithful interpreter of
Aristotle? Aegidius Romanus triumphantly vindicated the
Stagirite from the Averrhoïst deductions.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> On the other
hand, there continued to be those to whom Aristotelianism
and the expositions of Albertus Magnus and Aquinas
were anathema.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> In the end the latter triumphed over
their adversaries: Aquinas was canonized, Aristotle was
vindicated, and the Alberto-Thomist principle tended to
take the place of Platonic Augustinianism as the most
authoritative philosophy of the schools. It was far
otherwise with the anti-scholastic faction of Siger.
They, the literal slaves of Aristotle, accepting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>Averrhoïst interpretations of him without emendation,
refusing to accept the idea of any compromising adaptation
to suit the requirements of revealed truth, were
accused of maintaining that the Christian faith, in common
with all other religious creeds with their fables and
errors, was an obstacle to scientific enquiry leading to
the acquirement of exact truth.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> Here was Averrhoïsm
naked and unashamed indeed; but it is difficult to believe
that this accusation can be true. However that may be,
the Paris Averrhoïsts—and Siger very outspokenly—asserted
the collateral existence of two distinct truths,
the religious and the philosophical.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that principles of this type should
have been tolerated so long. In 1277 there came a change.
In January of that year Pope John XXI addressed a
letter to Etienne Tempier in which he bids him search
out notable errors in doctrine, since it is deplorable to
find the pure streams of Catholic faith, which it is the
special function of the University to send forth, being
grievously polluted.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> Thus commanded, Tempier set to
work once more, and this time produced a list of no fewer
than 219 errors.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> Again an attempt was made to confound
the Thomists with the Averrhoïsts, and the long list
included many very petty points. But the principal
errors enumerated are Averrhoïst and the list is obviously
aimed chiefly against Siger and Boëthius. The Bishop
not only produced the catalogue, but he fulminated a
decree pronouncing excommunication against all those
who harboured the opinions therein condemned. Henceforward
such persons were ‘suspect’ of heresy; and it is
not surprising that either in November 1277 or 1278—probably
the former—Siger and Boëthius were cited to
appear before the inquisitor of France, Simon du Val, in
the diocese of Noyon.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> The two Averrhoïsts seem to
have appealed against the inquisitor direct to the court
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>of Rome, probably on the grounds of the special privileges
of the University of Paris, the peculiar solicitude of the
papacy for the University, their own intrinsic importance
as teachers of great reputation and their persistent
declaration that they were true Catholics. The circumstances
of their latter days are obscure; but the strong
probability is that they made their way to Rome to purge
themselves from the suspicion of heresy, were tried before
the Inquisition of Tuscany, abjured their errors, were
duly reconciled and then penanced with perpetual
imprisonment.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> Siger died at Orvieto, certainly before
1300, since in that year Dante imagines a meeting with
him in his journey through Paradise. How comes it
that Dante places this heretic in Paradise? Two possible
conjectures have been put forward. The first that Dante
did so in ignorance of Siger’s true character, not being
sufficiently well versed in the current philosophy of the
time; the other, that he wanted to place in Paradise
some one who should represent the philosopher <i>par
excellence</i> as distinct from the theologian. It was not
easy to find such a one; and of the possible candidates,
Siger of Brabant was the most distinguished.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>Parisian Averrhoïsm, despite the condemnation of
its chief exponents, did not die with Siger, Boëthius and
the thirteenth century. In the next century a certain
John of Landun or of Ghent was preaching Averrhoïst
doctrine in the University and attacking the reputation
of St. Thomas; and he had numerous followers.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> But
by this time the chief centre of Averrhoïsm was tending
to be Padua rather than Paris. Here the Averrhoïst
school was founded by Peter of Abano, equally famous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>as physician, magician, astrologer and Averrhoïst, who
only escaped the clutches of the Inquisition by dying an
opportune natural death in 1316.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> The school there
also admitted its direct indebtedness to the Parisian,
John of Landun. From his days right down to the
seventeenth century speculations of an Averrhoïst
character continued to be discussed in northern Italy,
especially in Padua. In the late fifteenth and early
sixteenth centuries there were two rival Aristotelian
parties in Padua and Bologna, Averrhoïsts and
Alexandrists (so-called after the Greek commentator,
Alexander of Aphrodistias), who disputed academic-wise
concerning the personal or impersonal nature of immortality.
Of the Averrhoïsts the most distinguished
were Achellini, Augustino Nifo and Zimara; of the
Alexandrists, Pomponazzi. Although an Alexandrist,
this bold and lively thinker owed much to Averrhoës;
while it is an indication of the very academic nature of
Italian Averrhoïsm that Nifo, it is true after somewhat
modifying his views, was commissioned by Leo X to prove
as against Pomponazzi that Aristotle believed in the
immortality of the soul.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<p>The most perfervid opponent of Latin Averrhoïsm in
the Middle Ages was Raymond Lully, who made it his
dominant object in life to combat Islam in all its shapes
and forms. His schemes embraced the recovery of the
Holy Sepulchre and the conversion of all Jews and
Saracens; but he desired to attack not only the Koran,
but Moslem heterodoxy also, and to rescue the truths
of Christianity from the contaminations of the ‘great
commentator.’ To these ends he laboured untiringly and
with an intense zeal. We find him approaching the
Council of Vienne in 1311, with projects for the amalgamation
of the great military orders, a new crusade
against the infidel, the foundation of colleges for the
study of Arabic so that Moslem errors may be the more
easily confuted. Lully also desired the suppression of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>the works of Averrhoës in all schools, and the prohibition
of all Christians from reading them.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> It is remarkable
that the works of this great antagonist of Averrhoïsm
should have themselves come under suspicion of heresy.
It is probable that his followers, rather than Lully himself,
were responsible for the damaging of his reputation,
since some of them held opinions of a Joachite character.
But it is clear that in his animosity to Averrhoïsm Lully
went to the opposite extreme. Condemning the tenet
of the incompatibility of philosophy and revealed truth,
he was moved to maintain that there was no difference
between them, that there was no dividing line between
the rational and the supernatural.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> Therein was perhaps
as great error as in the contrary opinion. However that
may be, Nicholas Eymeric determined to have Lully’s
memory condemned, and in the ‘Directorium’ is particularly
venomous against him. In 1376 he exhibited a
papal bull condemning no fewer than 500 Lullist opinions
as heretical. The results were curious. These were in
the days of the Schism; and the Aragonese acknowledged
neither pope. Declaring the bull a forgery, perpetrated
by the inquisitor himself, the Lullists secured his banishment,
and Eymeric died in exile.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p>A better known enemy of Averrhoïsm than Raymond
Lully was Petrarch, who like Lully hated everything
that savoured of Islam. He hated its medicine and its
astronomy, but above all its philosophy. He makes the
Averrhoïsts—of whom it is clear he must have known
a number—targets of an indignant irony. They are
men who make it a point of honour to deny Christ and
the supernatural. Petrarch, his inspiration drawn from
the classics of paganism, a man who had witnessed and
loathed the abominations of Avignon, who regarded Rome
as ‘the temple of heresy,’ had no brief to defend the
orthodox creed. But to him Christianity was endeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>because of its humility, Averrhoïsm abhorrent because it
was dogmatic, self-confident, pedantic.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>This to the mediæval mind is the outstanding characteristic
of Averrhoïsm. It is insolent in the assurance
of its denials. In the fourteenth century Averrhoës
himself stands as the unique personification of the spirit
of unbelief; and as such is bracketed with Antichrist
and Mohammed.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> In this light he figures in the paintings
of Orcagna and others. To Gerson he is the most abominable
of all enemies of Christianity, to Petrarch a rabid
dog ever raging against the Catholic faith.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> The famous
phrase ‘the three impostors,’ which had first been
attributed by Gregory IX to Frederick II, and the
essential conception of which in book form was destined
to be attributed to many others from Boccaccio to
Erasmus, Rabelais to Milton, was fathered upon Averrhoës.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>
He had declared—so it was believed—that Moses,
Christ and Mohammed were three impostors who had deluded
the world; also that of the three religions, Judaism,
Christianity, Mohammedanism, the first was a religion
for babes, the second a sheer impossibility, the third fit
only for hogs. The Eucharist was the impossible feature
of Christianity, and Christians were especially hateful
because they ate the flesh of the God whom they professed
to adore.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting fact connected with
the story of the Islamic philosophy in Europe is the
fact that it helped to familiarize Christendom with
some of the features of another religion. It was not, of
course, the sole agency to do that; the Crusades played
their part. It is significant that many of the mediæval
stories and mystery plays have as their central idea
apostasy, which as a rule takes the form of conversion
to Mohammedanism. Even the religious wars in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Palestine did not breed exclusively antagonism to the
faith of the infidel, and friendly intercourse with Saracen
Spain and academic interest in Islamic philosophy
produced a knowledge that was less critical than sympathetic.
Such familiarity with the main conceptions
of other creeds rendered feasible the comparative
study of religion. That was to be an achievement
for a future age. Yet it needed no exact science of
the subject to encourage the spirit of toleration.
When other religions were discussed, were it only for
the sake of attacking and refuting them, still the curious
eye could not fail to be aware of their common elements.
Not even in Marsiglio is the principle of religious toleration
more notably set forth than in one of the tales
of the ‘Decameron,’ the pithy parable of ‘The Three
Rings,’ which inspired Lessing’s ‘Nathan the Wise.’<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>
Melchizedek in Boccaccio’s tale emphasizes in his analogue
the common elements in the three religions of Jew,
Moslem and Christian, each claiming to be the sole truth,
and no doubt one of them being in fact the truth, yet
so alike that none can tell which that one is. Boccaccio’s
attitude is one of sceptical indifference, and it is no far
cry from that to the attitude of Pulci in the ‘Morgante
Maggiore,’ in which the mood is one of complete levity
and all the forces of ridicule are brought against the
quips and quiddities of the theologian and the superiority
of Orlando’s God over Morgante’s original deity is made
to look exceedingly equivocal.</p>

<p>We must not allow ourselves to discover an Averrhoïst
origin for all the outspoken language used in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, in which Christianity
is regarded critically, objectively.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> It is no doubt true
that Averrhoïsm was principally an academic force
belonging to the universities, and that even there its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>adherents were never numerous. On the other hand,
there must inevitably have been some infiltration of
Averrhoïst ideas through the general community. There
must have been some dispersal through the agency
of the scholars who thronged the seats of learning, who
were more often than not wanderers from one school
to another, from Spain to France, from France to
England, from England to Italy, and who must have
scattered abroad the influences under which they themselves
were brought. There were from the point of
view of the Church two obviously dangerous features
in Averrhoïsm. First there was its anti-scholastic
nature, its determination to follow philosophy wheresoever
it might lead, regardless of whether it could be
reconciled with Christian dogma or not, a determination
which was accompanied by a bold insistence upon their
incompatibility in point of fact. In the resolution to
follow truth, untrammelled by religious dogma, there
might at the surface appear to be something of that
critical spirit which produced another anti-scholastic
revolt, that of Roger Bacon. But whereas in his case
the inductive method gave promise of progress in knowledge,
the possibility scarcely existed with philosophers
who were just as completely persuaded as was the most
orthodox mediæval saint that the truth had once and
for ever been vouchsafed to mankind, with the sole
difference that whereas the saint found the truth in the
Bible, the Averrhoïst found it in the treatises of Aristotle.
But the fact that he did so find it—in pagan and not
in sacred writ—was, one would have thought, radical
enough and dangerous enough; while the actual doctrines
he professed were as divorced from Christian belief,
as wildly heretical as any that the most fiercely persecuted
mediæval sect ever expressed. Nevertheless as
a rule the Averrhoïst was not persecuted.</p>

<p>At first glance this appears very surprising. Yet
the explanation is in reality simple enough. In the
first place, the Church was no enemy of speculative
thinking as such. The doctors, the masters and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
students who debated so earnestly, so vehemently,
abstract questions in philosophy as well as in theology
were themselves clerics; the universities were ecclesiastical
foundations; their studies were essentially
sacred, not profane. It was no part of the policy of the
mediæval Church to stifle enquiry and discussion by
those properly qualified concerning the ultimate truths
of existence. Such work might well be to the glory of
God and the permanent enrichment of the Church. And if
the Averrhoïsts did not, like Albertus Magnus and Aquinas
and the great Franciscan Augustinians, convert their learning
into Christian apologetics; on the other hand, they
were not like the wandering sectaries, whom the Church
did persecute, irresponsible unlearned laity, who spoke
of mysteries they were not fit to understand, but they
were themselves clergy under proper academic discipline
and supervision. Moreover, they did not attack the
Church; on the contrary, they professed themselves the
most devout true Catholics. Their interest in philosophy
was purely abstract; they had no ulterior motives,
no remotest idea of propaganda with a view to shaking
the authority of the Church or the filial allegiance to
her of a single one of her children. On the contrary,
they repeatedly and most emphatically asserted that
their philosophical tenets were exclusively academic
and not intended to have any bearing upon life and
conduct. Thus the Averrhoïst postulate of a double
truth, one philosophic, the other religious, stood its
adherents in good stead. We cannot to-day see into
the minds of these Latin Averrhoïsts, cannot tell whether
they persuaded themselves that they really were
Christians, were sincere in their conception of two irreconcilable
truths or adopted it merely as a convenient
subterfuge and were flippantly cynical or sardonically
insolent in their hypocrisy. The subterfuge served the
Averrhoïsts; whether its acquiescence in the subterfuge
served the Church is another matter. While the obviously
honest Waldensian and Beghard were harried to the
stake, the obviously dishonest Averrhoïst was usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
left at large. Was not the tendency of such discrepancy
of treatment to place a premium upon mere lip-service
and religious insincerity? From the fourteenth-century
Averrhoïst, with his idea of the double truth, it is but
one step to the fifteenth-century humanist, openly
indifferent to religion altogether, not troubling to consider
whether such a thing as religious truth exists
at all, seeking and discerning truth in the pagan world
only.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V - REFORM MOVEMENTS OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY
AND THE COUNCIL OF CONSTANCE</h3>

<p>The earlier heresies of the Middle Ages were of importance
for their own day and generation only, leaving
no permanent imprint on history. The Church was on
the whole very successful in combating them, actually
securing the destruction of the Albigenses and throughout
western Europe generally keeping the danger well in
check by the activities of the Holy Office. The story
of the Spiritual Franciscans, on the other hand, has a
deeper significance, for it is intimately connected with
momentous events which betokened the overthrow
of the mediæval order, the rooting up of certain fundamental
ideas associated with the matured conception
of the <i>Civitas Dei</i>. The one feature common to Waldensianism,
Catharism and the other early mediæval heresies,
which gives them any lasting importance, was their anti-sacerdotalism.
Clerical, and in particular papal, pretensions
tended to increase after the fall of the Hohenstaufen,
which left the papacy triumphant as the result
of its long struggle with the empire. The high-water
mark of those assertions was reached in 1300, when
Boniface VIII declared himself to be not only Pope
but also Caesar.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> By two most important bulls Boniface
sought to put his claims into practice, <i>Clericis laicos</i>,
which defined the rights of the clergy to immunity
from secular taxation, <i>Unam sanctam</i>, which declared
unequivocally the absolute supremacy of the pope over
the lay power, over every human creature in all respects.
The same uncompromising spirit was shown a little
later on by John XXII, the oppressor of the Spirituals,
an old man of immense vigour and a range of view
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>which embraced even the minute concerns of the secular
states of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p>Unhappily for itself, the setting forth of the papacy’s
highest pretensions was coincident with the maturing of
certain forces which tended to render those pretensions
null and void. The most important of these was the
force of nationality, the growth of nation-states, in
particular under the strong royal houses of the Capets
and the Angevins respectively in France and England.
In such nation-states the papacy was to find a more
formidable obstacle to the realization of its temporal
ambitions than the Empire had ever presented, especially
as they had no such tradition of alliance with the papacy
as was the heritage and indeed the technical origin and
justification of the Holy Roman Empire.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> The distinction
between the relation of the Pope to the Emperor
and the relation of the Pope to the King of France is
brought out forcibly in a work entitled ‘An Enquiry
touching the Power of the Pope,’ by Peter du Bois, who
in the year 1300 published a very remarkable treatise
which advocated a modest proposal for uniting the whole
of Europe under French sovereignty. The Emperor
was dependent upon the Pope, because he had to be
confirmed in his office and crowned by the Pope. No
such necessity existed in the case of the French King.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p>Certainly the conduct of Philip IV showed plenty of
independence in his relations with the Roman pontiff.
When Boniface in 1301 asserted that Philip held his
crown of him and summoned him to appear at a council
about to be assembled at Rome, the papal bull was
solemnly burnt in the French capital. The States-General
was then convened to give national expression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>to a protest against the action of Boniface; and bishops
and lesser clergy united with the people as a body, and
most important with the lawyers, to address letters of
remonstrance to Rome. The civil law directly challenged
the canon law.</p>

<p>In England the national feeling against papal exactions
and interference was extremely bitter and vociferous
under Henry III. Edward I gave a blunt answer to
the claims of <i>Clericis laicos</i> in ruling that if the clergy
were to be free of the law in respect of its duties they
should be free of it also as regards its privileges and its
protection, should be outlaws in fact. The stand taken
by the French and English kings on the subject of clerical
taxation was so firm that Boniface was forced to nullify
the bull <i>Clericis laicos</i> by the bull <i>Etsi de statu</i>. Not
only the royal will, but popular feeling is evidenced
under Edward III by the statutes of <i>Provisors</i> and
<i>Praemunire</i>.</p>

<p>While in Germany the imperial dignity had much
sunk in credit since the days of the Hohenstaufen, on
the other hand the importance of a national sentiment
there was revealed in the general support given to Lewis
of Bavaria. It is true that he failed in his expedition
to Italy, whither the German king journeyed in order
to establish his imperial dignity, despite his excommunication
by John XXII, by coronation at Rome, but in
Italy his forces were recruited by adherents more valuable
than armies in the General of the Franciscan Order,
Michael of Cesena, and a yet greater Franciscan, William
of Ockham. The issue that had been joined was in
reality one between papal and national sovereignty;
but in the lengthy war of words that ensued upon Lewis’s
failure in Italy the controversy appeared to be concerned
with the theological question of the poverty of Christ,
so that the feud between Spiritual and Conventual
became a European question. It now possessed a
significance extraneous from, and much wider than,
the original cause of quarrel: for in the doctrine of
apostolic poverty could be focussed all the widespread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
anti-sacerdotal feeling which revolted at the secular
preoccupations and ambitions of the clergy.</p>

<p>A heavy blow was struck at the overweening claims
of the papacy by Philip IV’s attack upon Boniface VIII,
and, as it has been said, ‘the drama of Anagni is to be
set against the drama of Canossa.’<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> But worse humiliations
were to follow, when the papacy was brought
under French tutelage by the ‘Babylonish Captivity’
of Avignon. Worse still, to the humiliation was added
infamy. The corruption at the new papal court speedily
became notorious. It surpassed all previous bounds,
and the cost of its luxury and prodigality was defrayed
by unparalleled extortion and simony.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> More powerful
than ever, therefore, became the denunciation of the
ugly materialism and spiritual decadence of the papacy.
The scandal of Avignon was followed by one more
deplorable still—the Schism. Christendom was presented
with the unedifying sight of successive rival
pontiffs, each anathematizing the other and reviling him
in terms of vulgar scurrility.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> No mystic halo could
remain undimmed, no sense of reverence unimpaired
by a spectacle so profane. The resistance of princely
prerogative, the emotion of national resentment against
caste privilege and exemption were reinforced by a
general consciousness of the violence done to men’s
ordinary sense of fitness, a consciousness mirrored in
the literature, and particularly the polemics, of the day.</p>

<p>If disgust with the papacy led Dante in his ‘De
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>Monarchia’ to find a solution of the world’s troubles in
a revival of the universal empire, of an effective imperial
authority, his vision being one of a golden age in the
past, in this respect he stood alone, and other writers
looked forward to a radical alteration and amendment
in the ecclesiastical polity. It was indeed a radical
innovation, but it was not so conceived by its authors,
who regarded it as the true practice of the Church and
were in some cases ready to denounce the Pope as a
heretic for disregarding it. The pulpits of the Grey
Friars resounded to denunciations of John XXII as
a heretic because he clave to earthly possessions and
repudiated the doctrine of the poverty of Christ and
His Disciples. But indeed the arguments of John’s
opponents were often so startling that it is in no way
surprising that he with all honesty perceived in <i>them</i>
the heretics. Michael of Cesena, in a tract against the
errors of the Pope, treated John as a mere heretic, and
appealed from him to a General Council representative
of the Catholic Church, since a Pope might err both in
faith and in conduct, as indeed many had erred before,
while the Catholic Church was infallible, and its representative,
a General Council, was necessarily endowed
with the like infallibility.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>Of far greater weight than that of the Franciscan
leader was the authority of William of Ockham in recommending
the device of a General Council. Only, unlike
the former, William of Ockham discerned infallibility
in neither Pope nor General Council. All human beings
are liable to err, whether individually or collectively,
but the ultimate power in the Church must be the Church
itself, the whole body of the faithful.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> In his enormous
work, his ‘Dialogus,’ there are contradictions and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
qualifications which indicate that the author was perplexed
by the manifold practical difficulties of the
problem of how to reunite Christendom.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> But as a
Spiritual Franciscan he was clear that the Pope had
no right to secular property, and as a philosopher preferred
the Church Universal itself to its pontiff as the
repository of truth.</p>

<p>Of much less influence and reputation in his own
lifetime than Ockham, yet of infinitely greater originality,
penetration and width of view, astonishingly farseeing and
modern in his standpoint, was Marsiglio of Padua. The
central argument of his ‘Defensor Pacis’ is that the
cause of all the turmoil and disturbance of the world has
been the bid for temporal power made by the clergy, and
especially the papacy.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> Christ had definitely stated,
‘My Kingdom is not of this world’; yet the clergy
had become utterly immersed in affairs of the earth.
Marsiglio equally combatted two sacerdotal contentions—the
right to intervene in secular matters in despite of the
spiritual office, on the one hand; on the other hand,
the right of exemption from the ordinary payments
and obligations of citizens in virtue of the same spiritual
office. He held that the clergy had one duty only,
and that a spiritual duty—to attend to the welfare of
the souls of their flock. They had no legitimate claim
whatever, in his opinion, to special treatment from the
lay authority.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> Their spiritual character was relative
only to their performance of spiritual functions; in
so far as they performed any others they were on exactly
the same footing as laymen. Their tenure of land should
be on precisely the same conditions as that of the laity;
the civil obligations of the layman were incumbent upon
them also. Similarly, they had no right to special
jurisdiction, involving the infliction of the same sort of
penalties—fines and imprisonments for example—as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>appertained to the secular courts. Such jurisdiction was
abhorrent to the spirit of the Gospel.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> To counsel
and to warn was within their province; to go beyond
that was not. This, according to Marsiglio, applied
even to heresy. If a heresy were dangerous to society,
it was for the civil authority to deal with it. Merely
as wrong opinion it was not punishable at all in this
world.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> While he thus restricted and narrowly defined
the functions of the priesthood, Marsiglio in no wise
narrowed the conception of the Catholic Church, but
rather broadened it. For his outstanding argument
is that the clergy <i>have</i> been narrowing that conception
by arrogating to themselves a position and powers which
belong to the whole community. While perniciously
extending the meaning of the word ‘spiritual’ to cover
such essentially secular things as property and political
power, they have as falsely contracted it to exclude from
all control of the Church’s destinies the mass of the laity.
They also, although not in orders, are religious men,
members of the Church; numerically they are by far
the greater part of the Church. Consequently, in a
General Council, which is a representative of the entire
Christian communion, and not merely a part—the fact
of ordination not making the clergy any the less a
fragment—in a General Council resides the ultimate
authority of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>In these remarkable pronouncements of Marsiglio of
Padua are contained the doctrines of democracy and of
toleration: so also in the careful allocation of the
clergy to purely spiritual functions is contained the
suggestion of that precise differentiation between Church
and State which perhaps more than anything else marks
off modern from mediæval society. The whole conception
of the ‘Defensor Pacis’ was revolutionary. No
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>heresy of the Middle Ages had been more dangerously
subversive of the whole system of the Catholic Church
as it then existed. The perverse absurdities of Catharism
and other such half-crazed cults were abhorrent to all
sane and healthily-minded men. But the doctrines
taught by Marsiglio have commended themselves to
many of the most sincere, the most devout and religious
of men from his own day to this.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>Were these opinions heretical or not? They were
declared to be so by John XXII; but amid the warring
religious factions of the period it was no easy matter to
say what was orthodox and what was not. The controversy
regarding mendicancy raged. The Minorites
declared Pope John a heretic because he would not agree
that mendicancy was enjoined by Scripture. The view
of the Pope was shared and soberly argued by Fitzralph,
Archbishop of Armagh. It was not only the worldly
cleric necessarily that failed to find warrant for the
contentions of the Spirituals in the Bible.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> A second
new tenet of the time—the dogma of the Beatific Vision—John
XXII, after first inclining to believe, latterly decided
to reject; and in 1331 a certain English Dominican, for
daring to assert that the souls of the righteous were
immediately wafted into the presence of God and beheld
Him without having to wait for the Day of Resurrection,
was by the Pope’s orders brought before the Inquisition,
and was thrown into gaol. John’s political opponents
in Germany and France, together with the Spiritual
Franciscans, immediately asserted the truth of the
doctrine he had denounced, the French King writing
to point out that the Pope’s ruling must seriously invalidate
the belief in the invocation of saints and also
all pardons and indulgences. John was forced to give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>way, and on his death-bed affirmed his adhesion to the
doctrine of the Beatific Vision. As he did not make a
formal recantation, however, of his previous error, Michael
of Cesena held him to have died a contumacious heretic.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>
A third new doctrine, a little later on, after considerable
and powerful opposition, gained a great triumph mainly
through the instrumentality of the University of Paris,
which forced Pope Clement VII to acknowledge its truth.
This was the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.
It had been resolutely condemned by St. Bernard, Peter
Lombard, and later by Thomas Aquinas. But the appeal
to the popular imagination of Mariolatry was too strong,
strong enough even to defeat the decision of the great
Doctor. It became inconceivable to the popular imagination,
which ever tended to prefer the sweetness and
gentleness of the Virgin to the awfulness of the Trinity,
to believe that she could have had any connection
whatever with sin. In 1387, when a certain Dominican
professor at Paris preached a sermon maintaining that
the Virgin was conceived in sin, there was a violent
uproar, leading to Clement VII’s consenting to declare
all those who held this view to be heretics.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> The confusion
as to the definition of orthodoxy and heresy,
inevitably produced by the introduction of such new
tenets as those just enumerated, was heightened by the
decadent unreality of philosophy, when it permitted of
the idea of a double truth, one theological, the other
philosophical, and rendered it possible for a scholar to
assert that even such cardinal doctrines as those of the
Trinity, immortality, the resurrection, the efficacy of
prayer might be true in theology, yet quite untrue in
philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> Such a disingenuous compromise put a
premium at once upon scepticism and insincerity.</p>

<p>There was one great schoolman living against whom,
despite the prolixity and barrenness of much of his logic,
no charge of unreality or insincerity can be brought—
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>John Wycliffe. Beneath the dialectical subtleties and
sophistries common to all the works of the scholastic
philosophers there was in his case a profound sense of
the obligation to seek, and a zealous desire to discover,
the absolute truth. As with all great thinkers who have
left a permanent mark on the history of religious and
political opinion, there was in Wycliffe a great moral
earnestness, an honest hatred of shams and impurities
and all that is ignoble. The scandals of Avignon and
the Schism helped to form the creed of Wycliffe, as they
did that of the most religiously-minded men of the
fourteenth century. His teaching was the moral repercussion
of a sensitive and powerful mind flung back from
impact against the clerical abuses of the Church. Indeed,
as in the case of Marsiglio, so in that of Wycliffe, his
attack was primarily on the polity of the Church, only
secondly on doctrine. Many of his writings are perfervid
denunciations, in the violent language common
to mediæval controversialists, of the ill-living, laxity and
ostentation of the clergy. His diatribes against successive
popes and the institution of the papacy became
more and more unmeasured in the choice of epithets.
The writings of Wycliffe cannot be taken as a true
description of the Church of his time, so great is the
allowance that has to be made for the hyperbolical
language of furious partizanship.</p>

<p>The constructive doctrine of Wycliffe is derived from
his idea of Lordship. His theology is given a feudal
structure, which cumbrously overweights it with technicalities
and analogies of interest only to a feudal age.
The whole of human society is conceived as holding
from God, the suzerain of all creation. The essential
characteristic which Wycliffe ascribed to it brings out
of this feudal nomenclature no mere analogy but a
pregnant idea. Wycliffe postulated a fundamental distinction
between spiritual and earthly tenure. The
feudal system on earth was one of many gradations
between the supreme overlord, the king, and the humblest
holder of land. But between God and His subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
there were no such gradations: each man held directly
of God.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> The consequences of this statement were
radical. For one thing it was reinforced by the contention
that dominion was founded in <i>grace</i> only (there
was no other lawful claim to rule or possession) and that
no man living in sin had any right to any gift of God,
whether that gift be spiritual or secular in nature. For
all other persons the right to such gifts was equal. Thus
the only test to a man’s right to possession was a moral
test.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> These principles and their applications, elaborated
in a work of immense length, ‘Of Civil Lordship,’ lead
logically, on their political side, to Communism: while,
on the religious side, they involve a democratic theory
of the spiritual equality of all Christians, which was
subversive of the claims of the priesthood, for whom the
belief in the absence of any ‘mediation’ between God
and man left no function.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>On the one hand, community of goods was regarded
as essential to Christians; on the other—even more
notably than in Marsiglio—the laity were accorded a
novel and prominent place in the Christian fellowship.
Clerical property was an abuse and the clergy ought to
live on alms, tithes being recognized as such.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> Wycliffe
did not exaggerate the theory of clerical poverty; he
did insist that the clergy must live simply and possess
nothing superfluous to ordinary needs.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> In accordance
with the theory of ‘grace’ or merit it was laid down that
such wealth as the clergy did enjoy should be taken away
from the undeserving. Such money could with greater
profit be given to the poor. It was for the secular power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>to deprive the unworthy clerk of his possessions.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> This
teaching regarding ecclesiastical property, the disposal
of which he virtually assigned to the laity, was perhaps
the most obnoxious element in Wycliffe’s general scheme
in the eyes of the Church in his day.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p>For the regeneration of the Church Wycliffe turned
from the hierarchy to the laity. That which makes
a man a member of the Church is his own personal
sanctity, and the Church therefore consists of those
predestined to salvation, of none others.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> The mere
fact of being a pope or a cardinal, for example, is
nothing. The Church can dispense with bad popes.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a>
They are antichrist. <i>Per contra</i>, a layman might be
pope, however unlearned, even if unordained, so long
as God had chosen him.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> It is not man’s appointment,
but God’s choosing—that is to say, spiritual excellence—that
matters.</p>

<p>The extraordinarily radical character of these theories
is obvious. They were subversive of the whole contemporary
conception of the character of the Church.
For a universal society Wycliffe substituted a small
body of the elect. In all this he was emphasizing the
spiritual nature of religion, as an inward force, the
possession of the individual soul. Confession, he declared,
was superfluous for the contrite;<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> no man could be
excommunicated unless he had first been excommunicated
<i>by himself</i>, and no prelate ought ever to
excommunicate anyone unless he knew that he had
already been excommunicated by God.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Like Luther after him, then, Wycliffe insisted upon
the inner reality of religion, of which the individual is
conscious in the depths of his own being. Like Luther
also he insisted on the necessity of appeal direct to the
Scriptures, as to the supreme authority for the Christian
life. As he looked to the laity to reform the Church,
so it was necessary that they should be well acquainted
with its text. The translation of the Bible into the
vulgar tongue became, therefore, an integral part of
Wycliffe’s scheme. There were extant in Wycliffe’s
day portions of the Scriptures in the vernacular.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> He
conceived the idea of translating all. Probably he
himself translated only the Gospels, or perhaps the whole
of the New Testament; one of his disciples did the
translation of the Old Testament, and may have completed
most of it before Wycliffe’s own death.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> The
significance of this great undertaking lies partly in its
completeness; but even more in the intention with
which it was adopted. The laity must be able to read
the actual text of the Scriptures for themselves without
the glosses of traditional interpretation and theologians’
exegesis, so that they may know the gospel in its simplicity
and view the realities of religion clearly for themselves.
To the Bible in the vernacular as such the Church had
no objection, but there must be proper safeguards. The
people must be taught how to read the Scriptures with
understanding by their spiritual masters. The gospel
of Christ had been entrusted to the clergy for them to
‘administer gently’ to the laity. Wycliffe’s method
meant that the ‘gospel pearl’ was ‘cast forth and
trodden down by swine.’<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>Wycliffe was an idealist, and confessedly his entire
conception of the Church and Society is an ideal conception.
In spite of its curiously matter-of-fact feudal
foundations, Wycliffe’s structure is not of the earth, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>Utopian. His conclusions were indeed whittled down
by certain important qualifications. Thus, although
all men were ideally equal, the existing mode of
society and government was sanctioned by God; and
it was therefore unlawful to seek to gain by force
the equality of possession which flagrantly did not
exist—so that Wycliffe’s communism, in so far as it
was not spiritual only, was purely anticipatory of a
new order in the future; so also it was unlawful to
challenge the right to rule of the civil lord on the ground
of personal unworthiness, for his power also is sanctioned.
As Wycliffe put it in a celebrated phrase, ‘God ought
to obey the Devil.’<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> Thus while the ideal theory of
dominion ‘founded in grace’ is suggestive of antinomianism
and revolution, Wycliffe’s practical teachings
were marked by devotion to the existing temporal
order. On the other hand, it is not surprising that
both opponents and followers should have tended to
fasten upon the former aspects of his tenets and give
to them a revolutionary interpretation. And indeed
the truly significant part of Wycliffite doctrine is revolutionary
in the emphasis that it lays upon the individual;
and as time went on both the logic of events and the
logic of the beliefs to which controversy drove him
rendered Wycliffe more and more unequivocal in the
essential radicalism of his attitude.</p>

<p>Anti-sacerdotalism led Wycliffe later on to attack
a doctrine to which the clergy owed much of their hold
upon the popular mind, whence largely came the peculiar
veneration in which they were held—the doctrine of
Transubstantiation. The miracle of the mass obtained
a special note of awesome mystery from that doctrine;
and to the ignorant or superstitious mind it was natural
to regard those who by the simple pronunciation of
the prayer of consecration could transform bread and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>wine into the body and blood of the Blessed Lord
as miracle-workers. For the orthodox philosophy of
Wycliffe’s day, Nominalism, there was little difficulty
in believing in such a transformation. Wycliffe was
a realist, and to him the nominalist position seemed
untenable altogether. In the days of Abelard, and again
in those of Thomas Aquinas, Realism had been the
orthodox philosophy, and Aquinas in demonstrating
that the abstract and general truths of Christianity
were acceptable to the reason did the Church of his day
a great service. But another realist had come after
him, who had most trenchantly attacked St. Thomas,
destroying all the reasonableness of the great Doctor’s
philosophic structure, and emphatically ousting the
reason and substituting the authority of the Church as
the only sure guide in the sacred mysteries of religion,
the only sure foundation of faith. There were action
and reaction in the abstract thought of the Middle Ages,
as indeed there have ever been in history. The reaction
against the Realism of St. Thomas, apparent in Duns
Scotus, grew intenser when the principles of Ockham
became the popular, and were recognized as the orthodox,
principles of Christian theology. It could easily be
shown that Realism was apt to lead to exaggerations
either heretical or absurd, very apt to end in Pantheism.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a>
The fact of the matter was that either school of the
scholastic philosophy might be productive of heresy, by
laying especial emphasis on one particular aspect of truth
to the exclusion of others; that different generations,
changing subtly in mental outlook and spiritual temperament,
are susceptible to different phases of truth. It is
not a matter of Yea or Nay, but simply a varying stress
of mode or fashion. But we do not look for recognition
of such a fact on the part of any mediæval controversialist.
There are no half lights and compromises with
them; they have each his own vision of truth, and
bitterly assail their opponents as enemies of the light.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<p>So Wycliffe, beginning with a standpoint which could
be shared, and in fact was shared, by many of the most
orthodox Catholics of his time, growing as he went on
more profoundly conscious of, and convinced of, the
rightness of his essential principles, became less and
less compromising, more and more the opponent not
only of practices but of the doctrines with which such
practices were associated. He became urgent against the
reigning nominalist creed, but most especially against
its theories of the Sacrament. For him space and time,
matter and form were objective realities. The bread and
wine were not a part of Christ and could not become
so; they remained bread and wine in substance and
could never be anything else, only Christ was present
in them.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> The doctrine of identification between the
bread and wine and the body and blood of Christ was
pernicious.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> Nothing could be more horrible than the
notion that a priest had the ability to ‘make’ God
daily.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> The language of the service of the Eucharist
was not literal, but figurative.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> The literal interpretation
was an invitation to mere idolatry, an encouragement
to the ignorant to worship the Host itself.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> Christ
indeed was present in the Sacrament, and the bread and
wine were not merely commemorative symbols; on
the other hand, there was no miraculous transformation
of the elements. This is very much the same theory as
Luther’s doctrine of Consubstantiation. Wycliffe united
with it the tenet that a priest living in mortal sin could
not consecrate.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></p>

<p>The extent and nature of the influence of Wycliffitism
in England is a difficult and somewhat controversial
question.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> The translation of the Bible certainly had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>its permanent influence; and the device of the Poor
Preachers spread the new doctrines further afield than
would have been possible in those days only with the aid
of lecture, sermon and treatise. Wycliffe’s character
does not appear to have been such as to have enabled
him to become the leader of a great popular movement.
He was too much of a schoolman; his method was too
academic.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> But the preachers—not to be thought of as
crude, semi-educated men, for they were mostly clerks
of Oxford, who had studied under Wycliffe—touched a
wider public than their master himself reached. Clearly
in popularizing, they also exaggerated his doctrines,
making them more downright, more practical, more
mundane, emphasizing their social tendencies, those communistic
elements which had a natural popular appeal.</p>

<p>The Lollards prospered greatly at the first, being
particularly successful in the capital itself, Norwich,
Bristol, Leicester, Northampton and the larger towns
generally. The protection of John of Gaunt and other
nobles helped them, while Wycliffe’s denunciation of the
friars met with the support of public opinion generally.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a>
There seemed a prospect of Wycliffitism becoming really
widespread. But separatist tendencies soon showed
themselves, and already in 1392 Lollards in the diocese
of Salisbury were undertaking ordinations. The Lollards,
then, soon showed a tendency to develop into a separate
sect, and their hold on the country and their national
influence decayed with extraordinary suddenness. This
was partly due to the fact that the movement had owed
much to the purely ephemeral factor of John of Gaunt’s
support; partly to the fact that the favour that its
social teachings had won among the peasants was more
than counterbalanced by the conservative apprehensions
of the larger population who viewed the activities of such
men as John Ball with dismay; partly to the fact that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>the movement produced sharp divisions in families,
between father and son, master and servant, and this
sort of thing could not last beyond a generation.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a>
Extremists took possession of Lollardy and it began to
betray a distinct iconoclastic character. But the orthodox
zeal of Henry IV and Henry V forced it very much
underground, and there were a number of recantations.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a>
Lollardy survived into the days of the Tudors, in small
communities in country districts, such as the Chilterns,
and there was certainly a measure of Wycliffite leaven in
the nation; but it is going too far to discover in Lollardy
a direct and potent influence in bringing about the
English Reformation.</p>

<p>The influence of Wycliffe was deeper and more
lasting and vital outside England than within it—for
there is a clear and very important connection between
Wycliffitism and Husitism in Bohemia. On the other
hand, it would be a mistake to regard Wycliffe as the
sole parent of the movement inaugurated by Hus; for
Hus had forerunners in Bohemia itself, earnest reformers,
such as Conrad Waldhäuser, John Militz Kremsier, and
Matthias of Janow.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> The two former were never accused
of harbouring heretical opinions; they were simply
protestants against clerical abuses. Matthias of Janow,
on the other hand, was definitely interested in dogma, a
professed theologian. He was notable in appealing directly
to the simple people of Christ in his denunciation of the
invocation of Saints and his insistence on the administration
of the Communion in both kinds to the laity.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<p>The beginnings of the religious movement in Bohemia
centre in the drama of the University of Prague, the
struggle between the German and native parties—a
national struggle which had its significant philosophic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>counterpart, for Teutonic Nominalism warred against
Czech Realism. The struggle was decided in favour of
the native party by the famous proclamation of Wenzel,
which led to the German exodus from the University.
The departure of the German scholars from Prague was
a momentous event. Hus and Jerome of Prague had
been expounding the doctrines of Wycliffe; the German
majority had pronounced these heretical. Wenzel’s
decision was therefore a triumph at once for Bohemian
nationalism and for the reforming Husite party, a victory
for Realism—for heresy. Hus’s satisfaction was great.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>
It was not only the religious issue that appealed to him
strongly: he was an intense patriot as well as a religious
reformer. The spread of the Husite doctrines, however,
naturally received a considerable impetus. The association
of certain religious opinions with those national
aspirations, to which the revolution at the University
had given so marked an encouragement, inevitably converted
Husitism into a popular movement. The cause
of Husitism and the cause of Bohemian nationalism
became so completely dovetailed the one into the other
that they were inseparable.</p>

<p>Hus received a papal summons to appear at Bologna
to answer for his heretical opinions, which were making
Husitism an European question, a dangerous problem to
the Church, as serious as Waldensianism and Catharism
had been.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> Hus did not go, appealing from the Pope to
Christ. The opinions of the great Bohemian leader were
not original; and indeed his greatness is much more
moral than intellectual. Starting his career solely as
a protestant against sacerdotal abuses, he was led by
the influence of the doctrines of Wycliffe, which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>close association between England and Bohemia at the
time made familiar in the latter country, into adopting
many of the tenets of the Oxford heresiarch.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> His ‘De
Ecclesia’ is little more than a translation of Wycliffe.
On the whole, he remained distinctly more orthodox
than his master. His writings abound in denunciations
of the worldliness of the clergy, in particular of the
papacy; denunciations of simony (which is heresy), of
the claim of the papacy to overlordship of the Church,
based on no better foundation than the death of
St. Peter in Rome.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> Heresy, he also declared, was not
triable by the Church.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> But the really fundamental
article of his questionable doctrines was his conception
of Predestination. Here he was following Augustine;
but he was under the influence of Wycliffe’s idea of
‘dominion founded in grace,’ which gave the right of
lordship and possession only to the elect.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> This principle,
involving the position that only the ‘rule of the saints’
is legitimate, had clearly a dangerous tendency, subversive
of law and order in an imperfect world, both
in the secular and the ecclesiastical spheres. Yet the
principal element of danger in Husitism was the simple
fact of its success. So serious was this that when the
remarkable attempt was made to heal the wounds of
Christendom by means of General Councils, the fathers
aimed at dealing with the problem of heresy together
with those of the restoration of the unity, which had been
broken by the Schism, and the reform of clerical abuses.</p>

<p>The Conciliar movement—a serious and important
attempt to reform the Church from within—was brought
about by the labours of certain moderate reformers, of
whom Gerson, Peter D’Ailly and Zabarella are the most
notable. Dietrich Niem represents a German influence;
but the main source of inspiration was the University
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>of Paris, firmly orthodox and nominalist and immensely
influential. In 1394 the University invited its members
to send in opinions as to the best means of ending the
Schism. Thousands of answers were received; but the
most outstanding members of the University were convinced
that the summoning of a General Council was
the only expedient that gave any hope of success. The
ideas of Marsiglio and Ockham—more especially the
latter—had borne fruit, and an age in which the idea of
representation was ‘in the air’ decided to apply the
principle to the Church for the urgent practical purpose
of removing a notorious scandal. The <i>apologia</i> for the
scheme is to be found in the writings of Gerson and D’Ailly,
and of Niem, if Niem is indeed the author of the tractate,
‘De modis uniendi et reformandi Ecclesiam.’<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> The
<i>plenitudo potestatis</i> of the Church resided in its whole
body, as represented in a General Council.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> With the
assent of such a council, the Church could even dispense
with a pope.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> It was legitimate for the civil authority
to summon a General Council. It was easy to cite the
practice of Roman Emperors to that effect.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> Christ,
urged representatives of the University of Paris to the
French king, had submitted to the authority of His
mother and Joseph. Was the Pope greater than Christ
that he should not submit to the authority of his mother,
the Church?<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> The proposition, so worded, seemed
mildly reasonable, certainly most orthodox. In truth it
was a democratic innovation of the utmost significance.
‘Pisa,’ wrote Gregorovius, referring to the first of the
series of councils which provide the chief interest of the
opening years of the fifteenth century, ‘was the first real
step towards the deliverance of the world from the papal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>hierarchy; it was already the Reformation’; while
the decree of the second and most important of the
councils, that of Constance, in which it declared its
superiority to the Pope, has been pronounced to be
‘probably the most revolutionary official document in
the history of the world.’<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> When brought up against
the glaring abuse of the papal schism it was not only
Wycliffe and Hus and their followers that became revolutionaries;
Gerson, D’Ailly, Niem and their adherents
became revolutionaries also. In the reforming programmes
of Wycliffe and Hus there was much that might
have been expected to gain the sympathies of the fathers
who met at Constance: yet they condemned both as
heretics and consigned Hus and Jerome of Prague to the
flames.</p>

<p>The explanation is easy enough. It was precisely
because their scheme was revolutionary that the cardinals
and other clergy assembled at Constance were so anxious
to make it clear to Christendom that such revolutionary
practice was perfectly compatible with strict orthodoxy
regarding the cardinal doctrines of the Christian faith,
that they were the guardians of the unity and continuity
of the essential life and identity of the Church. A proof
of this was urgently needed to safeguard a position which
had precarious elements. The opportunity of dealing
with Hus would probably have been welcomed for that
reason alone. As to the fact of Wycliffe and Hus being
dangerous heretics the fathers assembled at Constance
had no doubt whatever. Zealous for the reform of clerical
abuses as many of them were, they could only see in
the invectives against the hierarchy and the doctrines
concerning Predestination and the Eucharist, in which
the English and the Bohemian teachers indulged, an
attack upon the whole edifice of the Catholic Church.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>
Reconstruction they might desire; but the specific of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Wycliffe and Hus seemed to be extensive demolition
preparatory to the creation of a new structure. Hus,
therefore, came to Constance as one ‘suspect of heresy,’
virtually pre-condemned.</p>

<p>He answered the Council’s summons, relying upon
the security of Sigismund’s celebrated safe-conduct,
expecting to take part in a public debate, to receive a
fair and courteous hearing for his defence of his theological
views. Instead he found himself treated as a
criminal, thrown into prison, to answer a formidable
indictment before judges who were also prosecutors.
The Council virtually resolved itself into an inquisitorial
court and followed inquisitorial methods of
procedure. Compared indeed with an ordinary trial
by the Inquisition that of Hus was remarkably lenient.
He had powerful friends and the undertaking of
Sigismund counted for something, although certainly
not very much.</p>

<p>Sigismund has been arraigned as a monster of
turpitude for allowing Hus to be tried, condemned and
executed after he had granted him a safe-conduct. It
is certain that Hus, while clearly apprehensive of what
might ensue from his bold step of entering the stronghold
of his enemies, had implicit confidence in Sigismund’s
protection, and when despite the security promised by
the man who was both Emperor and president of the
Council, Hus was consigned to the stake, at first sight
unmitigated baseness on the part of Sigismund would
appear to be the only explanation.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> If he cannot be
entirely exonerated, on the other hand, it is quite clear
he never had any idea of protecting a heretic, and that
he was overruled by the Council, who, arguing from the
customary rules regarding heretics, could legitimately
maintain that no guarantee could have any validity
whatever in the case of one suspected of heresy, that
Sigismund’s safe-conduct might certainly apply to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>empire and secular states, might be valid while Hus
was on his journey, but had no validity as regards the
Church. The heretic or a man suspect of heresy could
enjoy neither rights nor privileges. This was good law,
both ecclesiastical and civil; and once granted that the
Council must regard Hus as suspect of heresy, it was
legally unanswerable.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></p>

<p>The trial resolved itself into a dialectical duel between
Hus and Cardinal D’Ailly, with divers interruptions
and at times uproar. Against the uproar, with which
his statements were sometimes greeted, Hus strongly
protested; and the proceedings would appear to have
been more seemly subsequently.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> He was accused of a
large number of doctrinal errors and of such absurdities
as that of claiming to be a person of the Trinity.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a>
Generally speaking, the object of his prosecutors was to
show that his opinions were identical with those of
Wycliffe, which had already been condemned as heretical
by the Council. It was easy enough to show that Hus
had inveighed against the organization and practices
of the Church as then existing; it was not so easy to
convict him of heretical dogma. From the first Hus’s
attitude was perfectly consistent. He wished to argue
his thesis; but that not being allowed, he declared
himself perfectly willing to abjure all tenets which he
had at any time avowed if the Council proved them
from Scripture to have been erroneous, but he strongly
protested against the ascription to him of statements he
had never made and interpretations that he had never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>intended.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> The Council, on the other hand, contended
that it was the duty of the suspect heretic to put himself
unreservedly in the hands of the Council, making an
entire submission to their ruling and a complete abjuration
of all the heresies with which he was charged. One
doctor told him that if the Council told him he had only
one eye, though he knew he had two, he ought to agree
that it was so. Hus replied: ‘If the whole world told
me so, so long as I have the use of my reason, I could
not say so without resisting my conscience.’ It is right
to add that the doctor subsequently withdrew his remark,
agreeing that he had not used a very good illustration.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<p>Where Hus gave his enemies their best opportunity
was in his teaching with regard to the predestined.
He had declared that no man living in a state of mortal
sin had any right to exercise authority. By this ruling
Sigismund himself would have been excluded. Apart
from that, as has been said already, the doctrine was
undeniably of perilous implication. The King of the
Romans could appreciate the seriousness of the political
application at all events. He pertinently reminded
Hus of the truth that no man lives without sin.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> But
the decisive factor in the trial of Hus proved eventually
to be his absolute sincerity. He refused to be false
to himself, to commit perjury in order to save his life.
‘Serene Prince,’ said he to Sigismund, ‘I do not want
to cling to any error, and I am perfectly willing to
submit to the determination of the Council. But I
may not offend God and my conscience by saying that
I hold heresies that I have never held.’<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> As he put
it again in a letter written shortly before his death,
‘Assuredly it is fitting for me rather to die than to flee
a momentary penalty to fall into the Lord’s hand and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>afterwards, perchance, into everlasting fire and shame.
And because I have appealed to Christ Jesus, the most
potent and just of all judges, committing my cause to
Him, therefore I stand by His judgment and sentence,
knowing that He will judge every man not on false
and erroneous evidence but on the true facts and merits
of his case.’<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> Hus died a martyr for no specific theological
dogma, heretical or otherwise, but for the noblest
cause for which a man can ever die—sincerity to the
truth that is in him.</p>

<p>After the condemnation and burning of Hus, the
Council proceeded to the trial of Jerome of Prague, who
after a recantation repented of it and elected to die
like his greater comrade. The proceedings against
him were marked by great heat and acrimony, for he
had made many personal enemies. Moreover, controversialist
passions, which had indeed been apparent
in the trial of Hus—for Hus was condemned as much
because he was a realist as anything—flared up with
still greater violence. Among the interested spectators
of the death at the stake of Jerome of Prague was the
great Italian humanist, Poggio. Much struck by the
martyr’s eloquence and genius, he thought it was a
great pity that he should have turned his attention to
heretical ideas, and half pityingly, half uncomprehendingly,
wondered that a man should be willing to die
merely for the sake of an opinion.</p>

<p>This chance connection between Jerome, the ardent
scholastic reformer, and Poggio, the cynical forerunner
of the New Learning—between the old order and the
new, is remarkable and prophetic. The movement
towards change, which Jerome of Prague represented,
whether it was a conservative movement as interpreted
by Gerson and D’Ailly, or radical as it became in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>hands of Wycliffe and Hus, definitely failed. The
mediæval system had indeed been challenged by that
movement, which had resulted from the glaring scandals
of Avignon and the papal Schism; but the system,
though severely shaken, yet remained; and pontiffs
such as Martin V, Eugenius IV and Pius II were able
by politic means to bolster it up through a restoration
of influence, mainly of a temporal nature, to the Papacy.
The Conciliar method of ecclesiastical reform failed
for a variety of reasons—partly because of defects in
organization and policy, still more because of a natural
failure to recognize the great significance of national
differences and the need, or at least the demand, for
variety of treatment as between states, which produced
the Pragmatic Sanctions of Bourges and Mainz, of the
years 1438 and 1439 respectively; yet more, precisely
because the attempted reforms were not sufficiently far-reaching
and thorough in character, a tinkering, not a
renewal.</p>

<p>The movements of Wycliffe and Hus were also
abortive of really direct results. Lollardy certainly
lived on, but, as has been already noted, probably did
not have any considerable influence among the various
forces which brought about the English Reformation.
The influence of Hus in Bohemian history is far greater
and the triumphs of Ziska and Prokop in the wars that
are known after the name of the great heresiarch won
national and religious independence for the Czechs up
to the time of the battle of the White Mountain in the
Thirty Years War. It is true also that Luther expressed
his own indebtedness to Hus, declaring, ‘We have all
been Husites without knowing it.’ Nevertheless, the
decisive influences which brought about the complete
overthrow of the mediæval system and the substitution
of the modern belong to the later fifteenth and early
sixteenth centuries. These influences were the humanism,
which in its Italian form became critical, pagan, drawing
its influence from the Greek world to which all the
‘ages of faith’ had been as an opaque curtain; which in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
its German form had a theological bias and a moral aim,
as interpreted by Reuchlin and the school of Deventer.
The other influence was the apotheosis of a cynical
nationalism, whose exponent is Machiavelli, which produced
the secularization of politics and the segregation
of Church and State.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, fanciful and erroneous to trace back
the causes of the Reformation and the break-down of
the mediæval world-state to the mediæval heresies and
movements of reform.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> On the other hand, to ignore
them would be equally mistaken. They had a minor
effect, but it was not insignificant. It may be the
violence of the storm that rends and tears away the
structure; yet its havoc has been aided by the almost
unseen, unheeded shifting of the sands.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI - THE MAGIC ARTS</h3>

<h4>(i) <i>Sorcery</i></h4>

<p>If such phenomena as the Flagellant and dancing manias,
the acceptance of such persons as Guglielma and Segarelli
as divine incarnations is evidence of the depth of credulous
superstition among the ignorant lower orders, the great
witchcraft and sorcery craze, especially in the fifteenth
century, is proof of a much wider diffusion of such a
spirit in mediæval society. Christianity early accepted
the belief in magic arts unquestioningly. The story of
the Witch of Endor would have been sufficient evidence,
even had it stood alone: which it was far from doing,
for the Bible was full of references to magicians,
demoniacs, and soothsayers. Thus it was in disbelief in
such things, not in belief, that heresy lay. Incredulity
challenged the authority of Scripture. Nor was it to be
argued that the existence of evil spirits in Old Testament
history was no warrant of their existence now.
The mediæval world was profoundly conscious of the
powers of Satan being abroad in the earth. It discerned
the clear sign of their presence in the frequent occurrence
of disaster to the undeserving, in the fits of the epileptic;
it discerned them in the wizened features of the shrivelled
old woman who muttered inarticulately as she gathered
her herbs. Given the combination of an ignorant and
wondering fear of the bewildering riddles of nature and
the cold strangeness of the stars with a sincere conviction
of the reality of that evil potentate who is at
war with God, causing disaster among men and having
subtle communion with the human heart, inspiring to
wicked deeds and hideous thoughts, it is small wonder
that imagination peopled the world with sorcerers,
magicians and witches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>And the evidence was so extraordinarily sound. No
reasonable man could resist the force of it. It was
not only the proverbially superstitious Middle Ages that
believed in occult arts; no one had a more wholesome
faith in these matters than Luther, and no country
surpassed Protestant Scotland in the savage cruelty of
its witch-trials. Richard Baxter, in his ‘The Certainty
of the World of Spirits,’ was able to give numerous well
authenticated cases from his own lifetime; and the
sceptical man of science, Glanvill, showed that unreason,
not reason, rejected the evidence for witchcraft. All
history was full of the exploits of these instruments of
darkness, and not ‘the easily deceivable vulgar only,’
but ‘wise and grave discerners’ were first-hand witnesses,
who had no interest ‘to agree together in a
common lie.’<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<p>The magicians and witches being almost universally
believed in, it followed as a corollary that they were
punished for their nefarious practices; but whereas
in the pagan Roman world they had been punished
simply on politic grounds, the magician being punished
‘because he injured man, not because he offended God,’<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>
in the Christian era the offence was regarded as a much
more heinous sin. In days of polytheism the state could
be tolerant of certain magic practices; not so Christianity,
which regarded all pagan deities as emanations of
the Devil. The punishments, save under the apostate
Julian, were usually of a most ferocious character,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>reputed magicians being crucified or flung to wild beasts.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a>
But while thus zealous in punishing the magician, there
is no doubt that Christianity itself became contaminated,
and in the Dark Ages thaumaturgy became rife within
the Church. On the other hand, while in the Eastern
Empire sorcery continued to be punished with severity,
the Teutonic tribes in the west, who in their pagan
days had been thoroughly imbued with magic beliefs,
were more or less tolerant. During the epoch of the
Carolingian empire ecclesiastical lenience, tempered by
occasional mob violence, was the rule; and such lenience
or indifference continued in western Europe till the end
of the twelfth century.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> Roger Bacon, unlike learned
philosophers of later and presumably more enlightened
periods, gave it as his opinion that reputed sorcery was
either fraudulent or a delusion. There are instances of
severity on the part of the secular authority in Spain,
and the first mediæval legislation against sorcery was
introduced in Venice in the twelfth century; yet the
Church remained apparently indifferent. And when the
Inquisition came into being, it was not given authority
in cases of witchcraft and sorcery. A change is to be
traced from Alexander IV’s bull, <i>Quod super nonnullis</i>,
issued in 1257, which laid it down that inquisitors were
not to be distracted from their all-important duties by
other business and were to leave cases of simple sorcery
to the ordinary ecclesiastical tribunals; on the other
hand, in sorcery cases where heresy was clearly involved,
they were to take cognizance. This became the Canon
law under Boniface VIII.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p>

<p>Now, when did sorcery clearly involve heresy?
It was not difficult to argue that it invariably did.
Sorcery was invoking demons, trafficking with Satan,
and to do this a man must surely entertain heretical ideas
about Satan and demons. Certainly, if a man dealt
in such trafficking, holding it to be not sinful, he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>a manifest heretic.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> Again, to seek to acquire knowledge
of the future from Satan, the future depending solely
on the Almighty, involved heresy. Under the title,
sorcery, there came to be included astronomy’s parent,
astrology.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> Some men of unquestioned orthodoxy gave
their sanction and support to it, notably Cardinal D’Ailly;
and it was not apparently definitely forbidden during
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in ecclesiastical
formularies. But clearly, although there was no question
of invoking demons in connection with astrology, on
the other hand, the astrologer by maintaining that a
man’s destiny was controlled by the conjunction of
stars and planets at his birth was denying the freedom
of the will, questioning the omnipotence of God, consequently
being guilty of manifest blasphemy and heresy.
Accordingly, the astrologer was always liable to prosecution
by the Inquisition. The best security lay in the
fact that belief in astrology was extremely widespread
among all classes of society, among clergy as well as
laity, of whatever degree of education. In the fourteenth
century there was a marked increase in sorcery. This
was probably the direct consequence of persecution on
the grounds of heresy—such persecution being in a
way the highest possible testimony to its genuineness.
For the Inquisition never dealt with a reputed magician
as a charlatan; it dealt with him as one really in league
with Satan. Otherwise there would have been no
heresy involved. The attitude of the Church towards
sorcery—its attribution of heresy to the magician<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>—actually
put a premium upon sorcery. The sorcerer
was the more in request because people were more
than ever convinced that his claims were well founded,
and he was able to make more out of his calling because
it had become precarious. For these reasons the extreme
zeal of Pope John XXII against all workers of magic
failed in its object. In 1317 he satisfied himself, on
grounds good or bad, that several persons in his household
had been plotting to take his life. Under torture
they stated that they had first had recourse to poison,
but that that ordinary humdrum method having failed,
they had next invoked the assistance of demons to
accomplish their purpose. The Pope was roused to
thorough and energetic action, and started a resolute
campaign against the accursed race of magicians. Dissatisfied
with the ambiguous terms of Alexander IV’s
directions to the Inquisition in matters of sorcery, he
gave it direct authority in such cases and urged it to
earnest efforts.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> Ten years later, however, for some
reason or other, he withdrew this jurisdiction from the
Inquisition; and it is to be gathered that there ensued
a period of comparative immunity for sorcery until
1374, when Gregory XI once more entrusted the task
of prosecuting magicians to the Holy Office.</p>

<p>The two most remarkable men to fall into the hands
of the Inquisition as sorcerers were Peter of Abano and
the Maréchal Gilles de Rais.[198] The former, an astrologer,
undoubtedly harboured speculations which were
flagrantly heretical; but he escaped the stake by dying
a natural death before his trial was concluded. The
latter—the original of the Blue-beard of the fairy-tale—had
been the constant and intimate companion of
Jeanne d’Arc during her leadership of the French
armies. Of such military distinction as to be made a
<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Marshal of France at the age of twenty-five, he was
also a man of culture, of a restless curiosity and an
intense love of things brilliant and beautiful, of rich
colours and ornaments, of all that was costly, magnificent
and ornate. But beneath all the gorgeous external
trappings of this æsthete was something much more
pernicious than mere vulgar ostentation. A depraved
voluptuary, he found that the ordinary modes of
satisfying his sensuality soon palled, and they were
succeeded by the most horrible unnatural lusts and
the slow torture leading to murder of his victims, in
the watching of which this monster eventually came
to find his chief delight. While he indulged himself
in such enormities, de Rais’ other great interest in life
was the practice of the necromantic art, by which he
hoped eventually to discover the philosopher’s stone,
which would place him in command of all the wealth
of the world. Notwithstanding the character of his
favourite pursuits, the Marshal was at the same time
particularly devout, showing an even perfervid faith,
and now and again resolving to make atonement for
his sins by going on crusade, never doubting that by
this means he would wipe out all the stain of his misdeeds
and eventually attain to salvation. In spite of
all this outward appearance of devotion, it is remarkable
that de Rais succeeded in maintaining his abominable
way so long without question. But secrecy and immunity
could not last indefinitely. Stories came to be
bruited about of strange and loathsome happenings
within the castle of Tiffanges, of children being slain
in order that with their blood the sensualist magician
might write a book of necromantic art. Even then,
owing to the Marshal’s high position, it was difficult
to strike. But eventually the Bishop of Nantes took
action, citing de Rais to appear before him on the
charges of having gratified his lust on children, whom
he had subsequently butchered, of having invoked
a familiar spirit with atrocious rites, and of having
committed other crimes also suggestive of heresy. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
trial that ensued was abnormal in several respects,
the most notable being its publicity, public opinion
being deliberately called into play, the fathers and
mothers of the children, who had been spirited away
into the monster’s castle, being allowed to let loose their
clamourings against the villain.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> Action was taken in
a civil court contemporaneously with the ecclesiastical
proceedings before bishop and inquisitors. In the
ecclesiastical court he was found guilty on both counts—first,
unnatural lust and sacrilege; second, heresy
and the invocation of demons; but his death-sentence
was pronounced in the civil court. The extraordinary
man underwent the final penalty with a contrition,
an assurance of salvation and an enthusiasm for God
which must have been strangely edifying.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></p>

<h4>(ii) <i>Witchcraft</i></h4>

<p>The great witchcraft craze did not seize upon Europe
until the beginning of the fifteenth century. It is true
that for hundreds of years before this crimes, which
became associated with the name of witchcraft, had
been known and punished, but until the twelfth century
we do not find the precise well-defined conception of
the witch as a woman who has entered into an unholy
compact with Satan, is in possession of certain miraculous
powers and in particular that of transporting herself
through the air to the so-called Sabbath, or rather
Sabbat, where she and her kind meet together to renew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>their allegiance to the Prince of Darkness. It is very
likely that the idea of the omnipresence of the powerful
and maleficent force of Satan took greater hold of western
Europe than ever before in the twelfth century, that
marvellous period of the earlier Renaissance, when men’s
minds were quickened to a new realization of the splendour
and beauty of things of the earth, when heresy took
a firm root, and doubt and hesitation sometimes usurped
the place of a faith which had been childlike and unquestioning,
a period of clashing between intellectual
aspiration and the inflexibility of dogma, such that the
timid and the ignorant were assailed by a vivid consciousness
of the dangers pressing around the Ark of the
Lord upon every side, of the sinister might of the dark
powers arrayed against the Redeemer. In such circumstances
more insistent, more clearly defined became
the conception of those evil beings going about in the
world, who had sold themselves to the Devil and were
assisting him in his fell purposes.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></p>

<p>At first the Church refused its sanction to the popular
tales about witches, more especially to the tale of the
Sabbat and the transportation of witches through the
air, often over immense distances. The canonists, Ivo
of Chartres and Gratian, dismiss this as a fiction: which
to believe is pagan, an error in the faith—in short heresy.
But popular credence triumphed over the canonists.
The reports of the activities of witches became so
numerous, so determined and so circumstantial that it
was wellnigh impossible to disbelieve. It became
simply a question of how to reconcile well-authenticated
facts with the canonists. A way out of the dilemma
was discovered in the fifteenth century, at a time when
the craze had almost reached its height. The witches
meant by the canonists must have been a different order
of being from those referred to by a later generation
when they spoke of witches. It was merely a matter
of nomenclature after all. Those responsible not only
for guarding the purity of the faith but also for pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>tecting
the faithful from the assaults of the Evil One as
delivered by witches could no longer allow their freedom
of action to be curtailed, the powers of the Devil actually
aggrandized by the misinterpreted ruling that belief
in witches was error. Accordingly, when a certain
eminent lawyer named Ponzinibio dared to maintain
the accuracy of the canonists and to assert that all belief
in witchcraft and sorcery was a delusion, the master of
the Sacred Palace, Bartholomew de Spina, wrote a
vehement and momentous reply, in which he turned the
vials of a righteous indignation against Ponzinibio and
called upon the Inquisition to proceed against the lawyer
as himself a fautor of heretics.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> The attitude of the
Church had indeed made a complete reversal. What
previously it had been heresy to assert it now became
heresy to deny. The divine law was now discovered
clearly to prove the existence of witches, and the
Scriptures were reinforced by the civil code.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> There no
longer remained any room for doubt or equivocation.</p>

<p>Before the end of the century there appeared Sprenger’s
celebrated ‘Malleus Maleficarum,’ the most authoritative
work in existence on witchcraft from the standpoint
of credulity.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> Sprenger was an inquisitor, so that in
his compendium, as in other similar treatises, we have
the conclusions regarding the nature and the practices
of witches, as ascertained by the examination of
supposedly authentic cases. We learn in the first place
the fundamental fact which explains the existence
of witches—the inherent inferiority of the female sex
to the male. Women are discontented, impatient
creatures, who have a natural proclivity to evil. Woman
is at the best a necessary evil. St. Chrysostom is
quoted with approval on the subject of marriage. ‘Quid
est mulier nisi amicitiae inimica, ineffugabilis poena,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>necessarium malum, naturalis tentatio, desirabilis
calamitas, domesticum periculum, delectabile detrimentum?...’<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a>
Everything considered, it was not
at all strange that women should be particularly prone
to yielding to the corrupt wiles and solicitations of the
Devil. Once bought by him, they received the sustenance
for their infamous activities in the Sabbat, the great
nocturnal assembly of the powers of darkness, held sometimes
in the Brocken, sometimes in some unidentified
spot east of Jordan, or indeed it might be in any spot
chosen by Satan. To the trysting-place, however distant
it might be, the witches flew through the air. This aërial
transportation to the Sabbat was in the opinion of
Sprenger and other first-rate authorities certainly no
illusion, it was a reality—only, according to Sprenger,
the witch travelled in an aërial body, a vaporous part
of herself, which issued out of her mouth and by the
existence of which she was enabled to be in two places
at one and the same time.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> At the nocturnal assemblage
there took place the offering of unqualified allegiance
to the Devil, feasting, dancing and sexual intercourse,
either with Satan himself or some of his demons.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> Foul
details occur in plenty in all the fifteenth-century treatises
on witchcraft concerning the sexual abominations
practised by ‘incubi’ and ‘succubi’ at the Sabbat.
From such horrid intercourse, we are informed by our
authors, proceed giants and wizards, such as Merlin, but
never an ordinary human being.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Bartholomew de Spina gives us a variety of circumstantial
stories about women who had taken part
in the witches’ gathering. One or two may be taken
as samples of a large class. A respected burgomaster
studied in his youth at Parma. Returning to his
lodgings one night late, he knocked in vain at the
door. He therefore let himself in by the window and
went upstairs, where he found the maid-servant lying
prone on the floor, naked and so inert as to appear
dead. When she at last came to herself, she acknowledged
that she had been to the Sabbat. This case,
comments Spina, proves that in the transportation to
the Sabbat no corporal transference is involved. The
body of the girl had lain all the time on the floor,
only her aërial spirit had been absent.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> Again, a man
one day finds his wife lying in an outhouse insensible,
and on recovery she confesses to having been to
the concourse. He is horrified, and, determined to rid
himself of his atrocious spouse, gives information against
her to the Inquisition, so that she may be burnt. The
woman apparently escaped this fate by drowning herself.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a>
One suspects a somewhat simpler explanation than
witchcraft of this tale of conjugal infelicity. Another
similar account is of a citizen of Ferrara, whose wife
was in the habit of attending the Sabbat. One night he,
pretending to be asleep, saw his wife rise, anoint herself
and fly out of the window. As soon as she was gone
he got up, and apparently succeeded in tracking her to
the wine-cellar of a noble of the town, where he found
her together with a number of witches. Directly he
was seen, they all disappeared. The unfortunate husband,
however, could not get away and was there discovered
by the servants of the house, who very naturally took
him for a burglar. Happily he succeeded in giving
satisfactory explanations to the owner of the house.
At the earliest possible opportunity he gave information
against his wife, whom he handed over to the punishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>she had deserved.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> Here again we get the hint that the
charge of witchcraft might be a useful weapon in the
armoury of a husband, should he desire for one reason or
another to separate from his wife—for good. Another
tale is of a girl who saw her mother rise out of bed,
anoint herself and fly out of the window. The girl
did likewise, acquiring apparently the power of flight
on the instant, and she found herself transported into
her mother’s presence. Then, being frightened, she
called upon the names of Jesus and the Virgin, and thereupon
found herself back in her bed.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p>The witches, who entered into their unholy compact
with Satan at the Sabbat, were there invested with
various tremendous and abominable powers. Unlike
sorcerers and magicians, who occasionally used their
black art to good purposes, witches could work nothing
else but evil. They were particularly fond of interfering
with procreation, where both men and women, because of
the connection with original sin, were most vulnerable.
They produced sterility in the one sex, impotence in the
other.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> Indeed it could be taken practically for certain
that these two evils were invariably due to witchcraft.
Witches also produced abortion and interfered with the
flow of the mother’s milk.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> They sometimes offered
up infants at their birth to demons; were vampires
and sustained themselves by sucking children’s blood.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a>
They were able to transform men and women into beasts,
to create tempests and thunder-storms.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> Indeed they
went about the world doing all manner of noxious damage,
ranging in seriousness from the breaking of crucifixes
to the destruction of human life. In their peregrinations
they were much assisted by their being able to transform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>themselves into the likeness of animals, particularly of
cats, so that it was very difficult to keep them out of
any dwelling-house they cared to visit.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> Indeed so
powerful and versatile were witches supposed to be,
not only by vulgar report, but according to authoritative
statement, that it may seem difficult to understand how
it could be imagined that any human agency could ever
get the better of them.</p>

<p>But something had to be done. The evil tended to
grow so disastrously, in this helped as a matter of fact—as
in the case of sorcery—by the Church’s decision that
the magic arts were no mere delusion but reality, and
that while the practiser of them was a heretic, to believe
that he or she was no charlatan but genuinely in league
with the Devil was sound doctrine. In this way were
men and women encouraged, whenever ill-fortune befell
them, to find a facile explanation for unmerited calamity
in such an intrinsically innocent incident, for example,
as that of a sinister-looking old woman with a hooked
nose having peered in at their cottage window. The
simple fact of being found wandering alone in fields or
woods after nightfall constituted legitimate evidence
before the Inquisition. Or again, if an old woman said
to someone who had injured her, ‘You will repent of this,’
and some misfortune subsequently occurred to the latter,
the old woman might easily on such trivial grounds be
suspect.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p>One of the most interesting and remarkable phenomena
of the history of witchcraft is that of the self-confessed
witch, the woman who deliberately and of her
own accord gave herself out to be possessed of supernatural
powers in spite of the terrible peril incurred by
such an announcement. The explanation of this is
partly economic—the law of supply and demand operating
in the case of the occult arts as a marketable
commodity, just as in any other—partly psychological.
Particularly when there was such unimpeachable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>authority for the reality and potency of the black arts,
there were always people quite anxious to avail themselves
of the means of fore-knowledge of, or avenging an injury,
or discomfiting a rival, and to pay handsomely for the
privilege. The demand existing, there were not wanting
those willing to satisfy it, to accept the risk in view of
the generosity of the remuneration. Sometimes the
reputed witch succeeded in persuading herself that she
was one in very deed. Some curious coincidence, the
desired object actually occurring after the utterance of
spells and incantations, persuaded the superstitious mind,
arguing ‘post hoc ergo propter hoc,’ that the spells and
incantations held in them a miraculous power. The
wretched woman would then with a vain pride or a
trembling apprehensive awe perceive in herself a being
supernatural.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> But clearly the greater proportion of
witchcraft lore is founded upon confessions wrung by
means of the rack from the supposed culprit when brought
before a civil or inquisitorial tribunal.</p>

<p>We do not know definitely when the Inquisition was
first employed against witchcraft; but certainly in 1374
it was determined by the papacy that the Holy Office
was competent to try such cases.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> In 1437 Eugenius IV
called upon inquisitors everywhere to exert themselves
against the evil.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> And there is no question that throughout
the fifteenth century the tribunal carried on a crusade
against witchcraft with great assiduity. Although
Sprenger was moved to confess that the extirpation
of the pest seemed an impossibility, being inclined to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>lay the blame on the carelessness and inactivity of the
secular authority,<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> nevertheless the number of executions
was terrible. We are told that in a single year the
Bishop of Bamberg destroyed six hundred witches, the
Bishop of Würzburg nine hundred.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> A thousand perished
in the same space of time in the diocese of Como.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> The
execution of witches, then, both in this century and the
next, assumed great proportions, largely owing to the
thoroughness of inquisitorial proceedings, though it must
be added—despite Sprenger’s animadversions upon its
slackness—that actually the civil authority was responsible
for many. The Inquisition, therefore, must bear
much of the blame for the spread of witchcraft, or rather—for
it amounted to the same thing—for the witchcraft
craze. Largely in its records were collected the great
stores of indisputable evidence of the reality of that
heresy which it had become one of the functions of the
tribunal to eradicate. By reason of its constitution and
its methods of procedure the Inquisition was always
a very effective court; but it was especially so in the
case of witches, because in dealing with them the inquisitor
felt that he was engaged in a personal combat with
Satan himself, and that he had to exert all his powers in
order to withstand, still more to overcome, so formidable
an adversary. Indeed it was very fortunate that he
was able to comfort himself with the knowledge that he
was impervious to the attacks of witchcraft. Nevertheless
it was felt necessary to take special precautions.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></p>

<p>Torture was used thoroughly where witches were
concerned, and no doubt the delirium thus occasioned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>the victim being willing to put an end to her torments by
saying what she knew her judge wanted her to say or
imagined he would like to hear, was productive of many
of the most marvellous witch stories to be found in
inquisitorial archives. But the severity of the torture
administered in these cases was due to the extraordinary
obduracy frequently shown by the victims. Such
obstinacy was taken as proof positive of Satanic assistance
afforded to these servants of hell, and the inquisitor
was therefore goaded to greater and greater cruelty,
because he felt himself put upon his mettle. The silence
of the accused thus became positive evidence of guilt, as
damning as confession under the pains of rack or pulley—perhaps
even more so.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> The gift of taciturnity, it
was conjectured, might be due to the wearing of a charm
somewhere on the person, so that as a preliminary to
the application the alleged witch had to be divested of
all her clothing for thorough investigation to be made.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a>
It was held that a witch was unable to shed tears under
torment, whereas—as Sprenger urges sententiously—it is
natural for women to weep. It was desirable therefore
to adjure the accused to shed tears.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> If this solemn
exhortation was successful and the victim did cry and
lament under torture, she was not necessarily the better
off; for this might well be a device to deceive, a wile of
the Devil’s to defeat the ends of justice. The inquisitor,
ever on the alert to discover such signs of Satanic intervention,
was apt to disbelieve in the genuineness of the
witch’s tears accordingly. Thus, whether it produced
confession or only obduracy, lamentation or silence,
torture was in any event practically certain to be successful.
Indeed anyone defamed of witchcraft before the
Inquisition became so inextricably enmeshed in the toils
that escape from conviction was hardly possible save in
the event of being able to prove that the accuser was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>actuated by mortal enmity.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> And even the most persistent
silence must, one imagines, practically always in
the end have been overborne. A sufficiently prolonged
continuance of torture must have produced the desired
result—answers to leading questions about the Sabbat,
detailed descriptions culled from the imagination of
demon orgies, confessions as to the invocation of evil
spirits and malpractices carried on by their help, finally
the incrimination of others. So the witchcraft legend
grew in substance, in precision, in lurid picturesqueness.
From the lips of the witches themselves came the authentic
particulars of the Sabbat, the flittings through the air
on broomsticks, the blasting of human lives by foul
spells, the inculpation of ever-increasing numbers in the
guilt and the heresy of witchcraft.</p>

<p>There is a most striking illustration of the astonishing
efficacy of inquisitorial methods in effectively defeating
their purpose, and actually producing the spread of the
witchcraft craze, in the famous case of the Vaudois or
witches of Arras in the years 1459-1460, when the
arrest of a single alleged witch led to the inculpation of
one after another, each new victim in her torments
naming others, including many of the wealthiest and
most important as well as the humblest citizens, so
that at length a positive panic was created.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> Not a
single member of the community in Arras could feel
himself or herself secure. No one dared leave the city
for fear that that innocent act might be seized upon as
a confession of guilt, and no one cared to enter for fear
of falling into the hands of the tribunal, thus busily
engaged in investigating an outburst of heresy of such
alarming proportions. To such a pass did things come
that the material prosperity of Arras was seriously
prejudiced, as people became afraid of having any
dealings with the city. One dangerous source of economic
disturbance was that all creditors demanded instant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>payment of their dues, fearing that their debtors might be
among those arrested, seeing that conviction involved the
confiscation of the victim’s property, and in such a case
the creditor was held to have no claim on any part of it.</p>

<p>In producing such results as these the inquisitor
was no doubt ever most sincere and disinterested,
genuinely aghast at the magnitude of the evil he was
charged to suppress, wholly blind to the fact that its
magnitude was mainly of his own creation. And in
the feeling that there could be no security so long as
the witch remained alive, he only shared the popular
view. It was simply the universal conviction that the
appropriate punishment of witchcraft and the only sure
remedy against it was death by fire. Nor was the
inquisitor alone in bringing offenders to the stake. The
civil courts and the ordinary episcopal courts were no
more lenient than the Holy Office. Even in Protestant
countries, where there was no Inquisition, the lot of
the supposed witch in the sixteenth century was no
more tolerable than in those countries where the
Inquisition still continued to flourish. The belief in the
reality of witchcraft had taken firm root everywhere,
and Catholic and Protestant were alike in their literal
interpretation of the terrible words of Scripture, ‘Thou
shalt not suffer a witch to live,’ which seemed to afford
all-sufficient sanction for the inexorable judgments of
all tribunals, whether clerical or lay. At the same time
the part played by the Inquisition forms one of the most
important chapters in the history of witchcraft, as it
was the most efficient and energetic tribunal engaged in
the prosecution of the heresy in its earlier days, inasmuch
especially as it contributed so much to the spread of the
belief by the convinced fanaticism of its members and
those methods of obtaining evidence, which not only led to
sure conviction and constant incriminations, but actually
provided the raw material of supposed fact on which
credulity was based. The voluminous records of the holy
tribunal, the learned treatises of its members are the
great repositories of the true and indisputable facts concerning
the abominable heresies of sorcery and witchcraft.</p>

<h2>PART II - THE INQUISITION</h2>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3>CHAPTER I - ATTITUDE OF THE CHURCH TOWARDS HERESY
PRIOR TO THE INSTITUTION OF THE INQUISITION</h3>

<p>The literal and fundamental meaning of the word Heresy
is <i>choosing</i>. The heretic is the man who selects certain
doctrines, discards others, giving rein to individual
preference in the realm of religious belief. Such an
attitude is essentially incompatible with the conception
that the truth has once and for all been delivered to the
saints, that the faith is indivisible and unalterable, to
be accepted in its entirety. It is easily understood that
eclecticism should be regarded as a danger in the earliest
days of a new religion by its adherents. The first proselytes
are anxious to define those distinctive features which
mark it off from other religions: for all religions have
certain elements in common. It was thus in the early
stages of Christianity, which shared certain characteristics
with such beliefs as Mithraism, Gnosticism, Neoplatonism.
The idea of man’s need of a mediator with heaven was
abroad in the Roman world before the Messiah was
proclaimed to it. There thus existed a danger of confusion,
that alien shoots of dogma might be grafted upon
the pure and original stock of Christianity. The influence
of such extraneous sources is apparent in the fourth
gospel. Even in the very earliest days when the body
of Christian belief consisted of little more than the
disciples’ recollections of the sayings and actions of their
Founder, when the simplest conception of pure and
undefiled religion was being taught,<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> even then the
faithful were warned to beware of ‘false prophets,’ ‘false
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>teachers’ who ‘privily shall bring in damnable heresies.’<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a>
As the fabric of dogma began to be woven, the note
became vehement. St. Paul denounces ‘false apostles,
deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the
apostles of Christ.’<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> In another place he declares, ‘But
though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other
gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto
you, let him be accursed.’<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> So far, however, even the
idea of what constitutes heresy is vague, and the spirit
of tolerance and of brotherliness is strong. The offender
is not to be counted as an enemy, but admonished as a
brother.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> The fact is that the flock is so small and the
pagan world outside so powerful that internal dissensions
cannot be permitted. But the new faith surviving,
doctrine becomes more stereotyped, the feeling of later
generations more confident. Polycarp finds the heretic
to be antichrist, who belongs to the Devil and is the oldest
son of Satan,<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> and Tertullian in one passage recommends
the employment of compulsion against the heretic.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<p>Such language is not common among the early Fathers.
They are themselves members of a society liable to persecution,
and they do not preach coercion. Lactantius
urges that the only weapon for Christians to use is their
reason; they must defend their faith not by violence,
but persuasion.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> The Church in those days had not the
opportunity to use force, even if it had wished to: and
this fact must be borne in mind in connection with
Tertullian’s enunciation of the principle of tolerance,
when he declares that the selection of his mode of worship
is a man’s natural right, the exercise of which cannot be
either harmful or profitable to his neighbour, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>it is not the part of a religion to compel men to embrace
it.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> In the (only apparent) contradiction between this
ruling and the counsel given regarding the treatment of
heretics, Tertullian laid down a principle of momentous
consequence for the future, namely, that while force
should not be applied to the unbeliever, its use is legitimate
in the case of the man who has once accepted the faith
and erred in it.</p>

<p>With the accession of Constantine, there dawned a
new era for the Christian Church. Till then the Roman
state had been neutral, when not actively hostile; from
this time onwards, with one brief interval, it was an
active supporter. The Church became possessed of all
the enormous power of the imperial authority. The
civil order is definitely Christian, and one of the prime
duties of the Emperor, lord of the world, is the protection
of the Church. Constantine speedily showed himself
anxious to take a leading part in ecclesiastical matters.
He had recourse to torture, confiscation of property,
exile and possibly the death penalty also in harrying
the Donatists.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></p>

<p>Donatism was a small thing in comparison with
Arianism, which shook the Christian Church to its
foundations. When the fathers of Nicaea decided the
intricate metaphysical question of ‘consubstantial,’ the
Emperor proclaimed exile for all who did not accept the
Council’s decision. Against this determination to root
out their enemies, to establish one interpretation of truth
by force, the Fathers made no protest, but accepted the
intervention of the secular authority on their behalf.
There was no thought of the possible consequence of such
a pact in the future.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> The triumph of the orthodox
was short-lived. The Arians were victorious later on
and in their turn persecuted the Trinitarians. The
Christians, said Julian the Apostate, treated each other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>like wild beasts. The punishments inflicted by one party
upon the other included imprisonment, flogging, torture,
death. To such a pass had doctrinal differences already
brought the adherents of a religion which proclaimed
peace and goodwill among men. The tradition of
persecution had been thoroughly established. The laws
of Theodosius II and Valentinian II enumerate as many
as thirty-two different heresies, all punishable, the
penalties being such as deprivation of civil rights, exile,
corporal punishment and death. But the heresies are
carefully differentiated, the severest penalties being
reserved for Manichæism, which had been punished by
the Roman state in its pagan, polytheistic and tolerant
days, because of its anti-social tendencies.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> But now
orthodox emperors persecuted Arians, Arian emperors
persecuted followers of Athanasius, simply because they
had taken sides in a theological controversy.</p>

<p>What view did the Church take of the activities of
the lay power? Was it actively approving or disapproving,
or passively acquiescent? We find some of the
Fathers still preaching the old doctrines of tolerance.
Athanasius, himself at the time persecuted, declared
that persecution was an invention of the Devil. To
Chrysostom heretics are as persons diseased, nearly blind,
assuredly to be led, not forced. He comments on the
parable of the tares, and urges the necessity of being very
careful, lest the godly be destroyed together with heretics.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a>
Jerome remembers that the Church was founded upon
persecutions and martyrdoms and on the whole seems
to inculcate lenience in treatment of heretics, though a
remark to the effect that Arius, at first only a single spark,
not being immediately extinguished, set the whole world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>on fire, and that corrupted flesh must be cut off, points
to a different opinion.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></p>

<p>The most significant of the later Fathers is St. Augustine.
In his case there is a notable change of front with regard
to the treatment of heretics. By temperament he was
an advocate of toleration, and at first, like Chrysostom,
he appeals to the parable of the tares in justification of
tolerance. Heretics should be allowed the opportunity
to correct themselves and to repent. They are to be
regarded as lost sheep. He is afraid that persecution
might lead to those who were in reality heretics becoming
hypocritical Catholics.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> But later on he altered his
opinions. He had found that the weapons of persuasion
and eloquence were not strong enough to break down the
obduracy of his enemies the Donatists. He had been
too optimistic. The methods of force employed by the
secular power were after all salutary and necessary.
‘He therefore, who refuses to obey the imperial laws,
when made against the truth of God, acquires a great
reward; he who refuses to obey, when they are
made for support of the divine truth, exposes himself
to most grievous punishment.’<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> He rejoices, therefore,
in a Christianized state. The death penalty he indeed
strongly reprobates as contrary to Christian charity, but
he approves both banishment and confiscation of
property.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> These later opinions of St. Augustine were
largely accepted after him.</p>

<p>An important episode in the history of the Church’s
attitude to heresy is the execution of the Spanish heretic,
Priscillian, by the Emperor Maximus. Priscillian’s teachings,
akin to Manichæism, were denounced by several
bishops, and it was upon their complaint that the Spaniard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>was brought before the imperial tyrant. The action of
the bishops, who had thus involved themselves in the
guilt of blood, wittingly or unwittingly, was severely
condemned by St. Ambrose and still more by Martin of
Tours, who refused to have any communion with them.
This happened in 385.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> In 447 it seemed that heresy
was reviving in Spain, and Pope Leo I expressly commended
the act of Maximus. He feared lest, if such
damnable error was not crushed, there should be an end
to all human and divine law; and if he did not ask for the
death sentence, he was quite willing that the Church
should acquiesce in the state’s severity and reap the
advantages resulting from it.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> Thus to welcome the
results of the shedding of blood in cases of heresy, while
refusing to accept the responsibility for it, constituted
a most dangerous attitude.</p>

<p>For centuries after the days of Leo I heresy almost
ceased to be a problem for the Church at all. Western
Christendom entered into the gloom of the Dark Ages,
its history the arid record of barbarian invasions and
the rivalries of Childerichs and Chilperichs. The human
intelligence was dormant: consequently heresy ceased
to be a force. When there is no mental activity, no
education, no discussion, there may be faith, there can
never be heresy. When the darkness lifted a little, heresy
once more became a problem. In 1022 thirteen Cathari
were burnt by order of, and in the presence of, King
Robert II of France. The punishment of heresy by fire
was an entire innovation. There was no existing law to
sanction it. The stake had been used by Roman emperors
to punish parricides, slaves who attempted their masters’
lives, and incendiaries, and it still existed as a punishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>for sorcerers and witches. The stake may have been
used on this occasion because it was an impressive and
theatrical death and, a choice being demanded between
abjuration and death, it was considered the latter should
be specially terrifying.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> Another execution of Cathari,
this time by hanging, took place in 1051 at Goslar in
Saxony in the presence of the Emperor Henry III. As
in France, so in Germany, the law knew neither the offence
nor the punishment. The Emperor was acting simply in
the public defence.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></p>

<p>It is important to note the part played in the treatment
of heretics at this period by the populace. In
both the cases just cited the secular prince had in his
action the full approval of the people. It is particularly
noticed by the chronicles of the first incident that the
deed was ‘regis jussu et universae plebis consensu.’<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a>
And Henry strengthened his position in the absence
of any written law by securing the agreement of his
subjects.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> Nothing could be better attested than the
crowd’s hatred of the heretic in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries, as far as northern Europe was concerned.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a>
In the south it was different. There are several instances
of the feeling in the north in the late decades of
the eleventh and early decades of the twelfth century.
For example, in 1076 at Cambrai a Catharan who had
been condemned by the bishop as a heretic (no sentence
pronounced) was seized upon by the bishop’s officers
and the mob, who placed him in some sort of cabin,
which they burned with the prisoner inside it. It is
said that the recantation of Roscellinus was due to the
threat of death at the hands of the populace.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> In 1114
certain heretics having been placed provisionally in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>prison by the Bishop of Strassburg were in the bishop’s
absence forcibly seized upon by the crowd, who, the
chronicler states, feared clerical lenience. They were
led out of the town and there burnt alive.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> A similar
event happened in Cologne in 1143; whilst two years
later at Liège the clergy only just succeeded in rescuing
the crowd’s victims from its clutches. Lawless violence
against heretics continued to evince itself in France
into the following century, there being instances of it
in Troyes, Nevers, Besançon, Paris, even at a time when
the secular power, under Philip Augustus, was active in
bringing heretics to the stake.</p>

<p>What was the attitude of the clergy in this period,
during which it seems evident that in northern Europe
secular princes and public opinion were united in thinking
heresy deserving of death, even by burning? There is the
evidence of the mob fearing clerical lenience in one case
cited, of the clergy actually intervening against the
crowd in another. When the heretics were burnt at
Cambrai in 1076 Gregory VII protested and ordered the
excommunication of the inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> And there is a
very notable protest against the use of force by Wazon,
Bishop of Liège (1042-8), who in answer to a query of
the Bishop of Châlons as to whether he should yield up
heretics to the secular arm or not, referred to the parable
of the tares in support of lenience.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> His successor,
Theoduin, on the other hand, is found counselling Henry I
of France to mete out punishment to the followers of
Berengar of Tours,<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> and about the same time we find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>the Archbishop of Milan giving some supposed
Manichæans the choice between abjuration and the
stake.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></p>

<p>The fact that most clearly emerges from the consideration
of rather conflicting evidence in this period
is the absence of any law regarding heretics. The mob,
secular princes and clergy are all acting irregularly,
taking measures in self-defence in the absence of written
rulings. Generally speaking, it would appear that there
is a prevailing idea that heresy merits the extreme
penalty. At the same time some attempt was made at
various ecclesiastical councils to standardize procedure
against heresy.</p>

<p>A Council at Rheims in 1049 spoke only of excommunication
as a punishment; one at Toulouse in 1119
did the same, but also called upon the secular arm to
render aid.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> The middle of the twelfth century saw a
great revival of both Roman and Canon law and the
publication of the Decree of Gratian. The Decree did
not put all uncertainty at an end. It certainly laid
down a clear ruling regarding the confiscation of property.
The heretic, being outside both human and divine law,
could not hold property. But regarding the death
penalty there could be no plain direction, because on
this subject Gratian’s authorities were contradictory
and remained so despite his efforts to reconcile them.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a>
Further efforts at definition were made by ecclesiastical
councils during the century. One sitting at Rheims
in 1157 demanded banishment and branding for those
who simply professed Catharism, for proselytizers perpetual
imprisonment; but it seems to hint at the
death penalty in the veiled phrase: ‘carcere perpetuo,
nisi gravius aliquid fieri debet visum, recludentur.’<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a>
Another Council at Tours in 1163, presided over by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Alexander III, reiterated the demand for incarceration
and also ordered the confiscation of goods.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> The
second Council of the Lateran of 1179, lamenting
the marked spread of heresy, commended the use of
force by the secular arm and proclaimed a two
years’ indulgence to all who should take up arms
against heretics.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></p>

<p>The first secular law in the Middle Ages dealing with
heresy is English. In 1166 two Cathari were brought
before Henry II at Oxford, whipped and branded with
a red key and banished.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> Shortly afterwards in the
same year appeared the clause in the Assize of Clarendon,
forbidding the sheltering of heretics on the pain of
having one’s house destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> Other severe secular
legislation soon appeared in other countries. In 1194
the Emperor Henry VI ordered the confiscation of the
property, and the destruction of the houses, of heretics
and inforced fines on communities and individuals who
neglected to assist, when they had the opportunity,
in the arrest of heretics.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> The same year Alfonso II
of Aragon, aiming at expelling all Manichæans and
Waldenses from his dominions, issued an edict declaring
all heretics public enemies and banishing them.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> The
ineffectiveness of this edict is demonstrated by the
appearance of a severer one three years later issued
by Alfonso’s successor, Pedro II, famous as the victor
over the Moors at Las Navas de Tolosa, equally
notorious for his warlike prowess, his religious zeal,
his prodigality and licentiousness. Once again banishment
is decreed, but it is added that if any heretics
remain in defiance of the edict after a specified date
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>they shall perish at the stake and their effects be
confiscated.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></p>

<p>Whatever may have been the case earlier, there seems
good evidence of the zeal of the clergy against heretics
in the latter part of the twelfth century, which saw so
much more precision in the declarations of ecclesiastical
councils and secular laws on the subject. In 1167 we
find the Abbot of Vézelai, when several heretics were
before him, appealing to the people to give sentence,
and accepting their demand for a death of torture.
Some years later at Rheims we find the Archbishop and
clergy in agreement with the nobles that two Catharan
women should be burnt.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> Hugh, Bishop of Auxerre
(1183-1206), is a busy prosecutor of heretics, causing
many to be burnt or exiled. More notable than such
isolated instances of clerical activity is the co-operation
between Pope and Emperor which led to the important
bull entitled <i>Ad abolendam</i>.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> In 1184, Lucius III and
Frederick Barbarossa met at Verona, and as the result
of their conference this bull was promulgated, which
(among other provisions) fixed rules for the prosecution
of suspected heretics, the visitation of infected areas and
the assistance of all civil authorities. The Emperor for
his part placed heretics under the ban of the empire.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a>
The decree of Henry VI, already referred to, was plainly
based on this action of his predecessor’s.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the twelfth century, then, we have
clear evidence of secular and ecclesiastical authorities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>working hand in hand for the suppression of heresy.
To the former, heresy seemed equivalent to rebellion; to
the latter, equivalent to murder, being the murder of
the soul. When Pedro II issued his harsh edict against
the Cathari of Aragon, he claimed that he was actuated
by zeal for the public welfare and a desire to obey the
canons of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> There was no order in the canons
that heretics should be burnt to death; but otherwise,
Pedro’s appeal to Canon law was justified: and besides
the canons, there were the various edicts of ecclesiastical
councils during the century, all of them calling upon
the secular authority to use its utmost efforts towards
the eradication of heresy.</p>

<p>It has been urged that the attitude adopted by the
Church was a most unwilling attitude, forced upon it
by influences too powerful to resist, that the main motive
power of persecution came not from the Church, but
from the lay authority and from public opinion. The
theory is advanced that during the period, roughly
from 1000 to 1150, when the position of the heretic
was a matter of legal uncertainty, the clergy opposed
the violence evinced against heretics, and in eventually
yielding they submitted to the strength of a custom
which constituted a sort of <i>jus non scriptum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> But
there is not much force in this plea. To acquiesce in a
<i>jus non scriptum</i> argues either indifference or impotence:
and the Church in the eleventh and twelfth centuries
was neither indifferent nor impotent. Nor is the
opposition of the clergy to mob violence an argument
to the point. A dislike for mob law and lynching does
not necessarily betoken disapproval of capital punishment.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a>
It is true—and this is very important—that
spontaneously, without any direct incitement from the
clergy, the people regarded the heretic with intense
abhorrence. We ought probably to add that in the
absence of written law on the subject there was a rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>vague idea, shared by the mob and their rulers, that not
only death, but a particularly terrible kind of death,
was an appropriate punishment for the heretic—this
idea being perhaps derived from the fact that Roman
law had at different times meted out this doom for
certain kinds of heretics, particularly Manichæans, and
other offenders, such as sorcerers and witches. It is true
also that the heretics upon whom the mob turned were
generally Manichæan. Yet no one who has any knowledge
of the position of the mediæval Church can honestly
maintain on these grounds that the Church had no responsibility
for the rigour displayed towards the heretic.
The heretic was regarded as an offender against society,
because it was a Christian society. Heresy, being error in
the faith, was investigated and recognized by the Church.
The clergy, not the mob, discovered the heresy and the
heretic; for such discovery could not be made without
theological knowledge, of which the mob were ignorant.
And such knowledge as they possessed, were it reasoned
understanding or merely half-assimilated fragments of
doctrine, was derived solely from clerical instruction.
It was difficult for any sort of knowledge to come from
any other source. Heresy was regarded as dangerous
to the community, because, to begin with, the Church
had found it dangerous to itself. The intellectual
and spiritual atmosphere with which Christendom was
permeated was of the Church’s making. The attempt,
therefore, to absolve the Church from responsibility
for the measures taken against heresy in these centuries—by
whomsoever they were taken—involves a wholly
erroneous, indeed an absurd, under-estimate of the
authority of the Church.</p>

<p>In 1198 there came to the papal throne perhaps the
greatest of the whole pontifical line, Lothario Conti,
Innocent III. High in resolve to strengthen Church
and Papacy, he at once gave his attention to the problem
of heresy. But though zealous, in some respects he
showed a commendable moderation. He was anxious
that the innocent should not be confounded with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
guilty in the impetuosity of the perfervid clerk or the
impatience of the mob; and for the first ten years of
his pontificate he made trial of a pacific programme.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a>
But in one part of Christendom the problem of heresy
had by this time become acute. In the lands of the
Count of Toulouse, Catharism was as rampant as were
clerical abuses. The pleasure-loving, prosperous inhabitants
of Provence, of Narbonne, of Albi felt the
authority of the Church to be an obnoxious incubus
upon their worldliness, their careless independence.
The clergy were hated and despised. The troubadour
made pleasant ridicule of the sacraments and every
doctrine of the Church, however sacred. The death-bed
repentance scheme of the Catharan system, its denial
of a purgatory and a hell, were popular. Still more so
was the pretext afforded by its anti-sacerdotal precepts
for despoiling the Church.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> So the nobles and the rich
<i>bourgeoisie</i> and merchants received heretics into their
houses, clothed them and fed them, while they were
exempted from taxes. So great was the hold of heresy
in his lands, that Count Raymond V of Toulouse declared
himself to be wholly unable to resist it.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> His successor,
Raymond VI, had no wish to resist it, being of the same
stuff as his people and seeing no call to disturb them
at the bidding of priests. Thus when a Council at
Montpellier in 1195 anathematized all princes failing
to enforce the Church’s decrees against heretics, he
paid no heed.</p>

<p>A couple of months after his accession Innocent III
sent two commissioners into Languedoc, one of them
being subsequently entrusted with legatine powers, to
tackle a situation so serious that the whole of that
country seemed on the point of slipping away from its
allegiance to the Catholic faith and communion. They
were instructed that obdurate heretics were to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>banished, their property confiscated; and the secular
authority was to see to it that their measures were carried
out under pain of interdict. The efforts of these two
commissioners were entirely fruitless. In 1204 their
successors were entrusted with increased authority,
which gave them a complete dictatorship over the
ecclesiastical dignitaries of Languedoc, who were bitterly
reviled for their incapacity. Yet neither these measures
nor lavish bribes to secular rulers proved efficacious,
and even the iron resolution of the commissioners, Pierre
de Castelnau and Arnaud of Citeaux, was breaking down
beneath the weight of persistent failure, when a certain
Spaniard, Diego de Arzevedo, Bishop of Osma, suggested
to the legates the scheme of an evangelistic enterprise.
This was adopted, and bare-footed missionaries were
sent forth to re-convert the erring by simple preaching
and exhortation. Among the preachers was St. Dominic
himself. This laudable scheme also failed. There is a
legend that Dominic, stung by his ill-success, predicted
what the upshot of such deplorable obduracy must
eventually be. There was a saying in Spain, he quoted,
that a beating may work where a blessing won’t. The
towers of the cities of the fair land would have to be
laid low, its people reduced to servitude.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> The actual
signal for a complete reversal of policy was the murder
of Pierre de Castelnau in circumstances which recall
the murder of Becket. The legate had exasperated the
Count of Toulouse; one of the latter’s knights slew
the priest. Innocent called for vengeance upon the
blood-guilty Count; and the Albigensian Crusade, which
Innocent had ere this been preaching in vain to
Philip Augustus of France, was the immediate consequence.
The first crusading army, an international
force, assembled at Lyons in June 1209.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> The ensuing
wars are memorable for the men who took part in them—Pedro
of Aragon, the zealous Catholic, now intervening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>on behalf of Count Raymond and perishing on the field
of Muret, Simon de Montfort, the ‘athlete of Christ’!
Never was there Christian warrior purer in his motives
than Simon, more whole-hearted in his enthusiasm,
or more utterly inhuman in his fanaticism. These
wars are also memorable for their political issues and
consequences. From the outset purely political interests
were intermixed with the religious. The great nobles
who led the forces of the Cross united with their pious
zeal an at least equally genuine and powerful hatred
and jealousy of the rich and bountiful southern land
which harboured a culture so different from their own,
more Saracen than European. The wars were wars of
the north against the south, of one civilization against
another. The astute and calculating Philip Augustus
seized with avidity the opportunity of bringing under
his direct control a province of France, which had been
practically an independent kingdom; and the crusade
is, therefore, of first-rate importance as a big contribution
to the unification of the French kingdom.</p>

<p>If to many who took part in them the original purpose
of these religious wars was altogether subsidiary, that
purpose was none the less most horribly accomplished.
The peculiar civilization of Languedoc was blotted out,
its beauty and fragrance being utterly extinguished by
the onslaught of the crusaders. With the civilization
went the heresy that it had harboured. Catharism
indeed continued to exist in the devastated region, but
all its vital power of expansion had been destroyed when
the conditions that fostered it vanished. The Albigensian
wars were the most successful attempt to extirpate heresy
known in history. They were successful because they
were utterly ruthless and included wholesale massacres.
When the town of Béziers fell, it is said that twenty
thousand of its inhabitants were slaughtered. There
were good Catholics as well as Cathari among the populace
of the place; but the story goes that when Arnaud of
Citeaux was asked whether the Catholics were to be
spared, in his anxiety lest a single heretic should escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
by pretending orthodoxy, he replied, ‘Kill them all, for
God knows His own.’<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></p>

<p>When the crusaders appeared in Languedoc, toleration
vanished out of western Christendom. There was no
asylum left where the heretic could feel assured of safety
from the persecutor. The power of the Church against
the disobedient had been mightily asserted. The ruler
who had dared to disregard her order to purify his land
of its contaminators had been brought low. From
every country the papacy had been able to bring together
doughty warriors to uphold the unity of the faith by
spilling the blood of the perverse wanderers from the fold.
The policy of force had been triumphantly vindicated
by the amplitude of its success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER II - THE BEGINNINGS OF THE INQUISITION</h3>

<p>Originally jurisdiction over heresy belonged to the
ordinary ecclesiastical courts, heresy being classed with
such other offences as adultery and breach of contract,
which came under ecclesiastical purview.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> The special
tribunal of the Inquisition came into being because these
courts proved defective for the trial of heresy. In the
first place, the new offence became so frequent that
the ordinary courts were unable to support the large
additional burden without impairing their efficiency
in the performance of their original duties.</p>

<p>How, then, did it happen that whereas heresy had
become a formidable danger in the twelfth century,
the institution of the special tribunal did not take place
until the thirteenth? The suggestion appears plausible
that there must have been some other cause besides
the mere spread of heresy to account for the birth of
the Inquisition at that date.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> The answer is that it
took time for heresy to be recognized as sufficiently
serious to warrant the creation of an entirely new
organization, and before the magnitude of the task
of repressing religious error was fully apprehended.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> In
the second place, the papacy during this period was
much preoccupied with more pressing concerns,
particularly the investiture question, which involved
the supreme issue as to the pre-eminence of secular or
spiritual authority in Christendom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>When once attention had been thoroughly arrested
by the problem, the deficiencies of the existing spiritual
courts for the new work became apparent. Overwork
was by no means the only drawback. The character
of the judges was at fault. Even after the Hildebrandine
reforms, bishops still remained feudal barons with many
inevitable secular distractions; archdeacons and other
lesser officials were often venal and incapable.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> In
any case the very nature of diocesan authority militated
against success. It was too purely local to be effective
against offenders who could easily migrate from one
part of the country to another. Even more serious
was the lack on the part of the existing officials of special
training and knowledge, especially in theology, which
were found necessary, since heretics often evinced
diabolical familiarity with the text of Scripture.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a>
Lacking such special equipment and being badly pressed
for time on a diocesan visitation, the bishop was apt to
come to a hurried and arbitrary judgment, frequently
falling back upon the device of the ordeal when the
defendant pleaded ‘not guilty.’ Both the Councils
of Rheims of 1157 and of Verona of 1184 ordered
that suspects of heresy should be submitted to this
test. But the method was never felt to be satisfactory,
was strongly condemned by Ivo of Chartres and
Alexander III, and so emphatically denounced by
the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215 that it
disappeared from the practice of lay as well as spiritual
courts.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage under which the episcopal
courts laboured in dealing with heresy was their procedure,
that of Roman Law. There were two systems—those
of <i>denuntiatio</i> and <i>accusatio</i>. In the former
some person in authority—in ecclesiastical cases the
archdeacon—brought forward a charge founded upon
his own personal knowledge. In the latter the charge
was based on information tendered by a private
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>individual to the authorities. Owing to the fact that
the archdeacon was a very busy man, the Church was
largely dependent on the second method in the prosecution
of heresy. But the average person had no inducement
to lodge a charge. He was in danger of private
vengeance if he did so; equally important, by Roman
Law he was expected to prove his case, being in the
event of failure liable to the same penalty which he
had himself alleged against the accused. Seeing that,
should he prove his case, he was entitled to the property
of the prisoner either in whole or in part, this stipulation
was a salutary and indeed necessary check, not
only on malice but cupidity.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> This mode of procedure,
which though indicative of its origin in the rudimentary
idea of private justice was certainly equitable, did not
commend itself to the Church, once it had become
determined upon the extirpation of heresy. The
difficulty of obtaining convictions greatly increased
when, instead of small isolated communities, the Church
was faced by a great organization like Catharism, widespread
and secret in its movements. It was clear that
episcopal jurisdiction must be strengthened. The Edict
of Verona was an attempt in this direction. It was
resolved to make use for prosecution of common report,
the public opinion of the locality. Archbishops and
bishops were to visit in person, or through their archdeacons,
once or even twice a year every parish in which
heresy was supposed to exist, and were to compel men
whom they thought of trustworthy character or, if they
thought fit, all the inhabitants of the neighbourhood,
to denounce those whose manner of living differed from
that of good Catholics. Such bad characters were to
purge themselves by a solemn oath on the gospels before
the bishop (<i>purgatio canonica</i>); if they refused—and
Cathari were likely to be unwilling owing to their views
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>regarding oaths—their refusal was to be construed as
tantamount to a confession of heresy.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></p>

<p>We have here a method of enforced delation, the bishop
proceeding upon the evidence so obtained (<i>diffamatio</i>)
without the formalities of the <i>accusatio</i>. In other words
the bishops are to make an <i>inquest</i>, so that from this date,
1184, we have in existence an episcopal inquisition.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a>
The decree does not appear to have been very effective,
and after the Albigensian Crusades—it being necessary to
follow that success by the institution of systematic prosecution
of heresy for fear of the recurrence of trouble<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a>—similar
regulations were made by Councils, sitting at
Avignon in 1209 and at Montpellier in 1215, also in the
Fourth Council of the Lateran of the latter year. There
was a new feature in the introduction of a priest in addition
to a trustworthy layman as informer against heretics.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a>
The Council of Narbonne (1227) went a step further in
ordering the bishops to appoint in each parish <i>testes
synodales</i>, to make diligent enquiry concerning heresy and
other matters and give information to their bishops.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a>
The phrase ‘synodal witness’ is new, though it may
easily designate the same persons as those nominated
by the previous councils. However this may be, the
‘synodal witnesses’ are entrusted with a new duty. They
are not merely to inform, but to search out. This advance
was to be anticipated; the informer easily blossoms
out into the detective. Here we have a system of local
Inquisition, which is enjoined again by a Council sitting
at Toulouse two years later, which requires the synodal
witnesses to visit all suspected houses and hiding-places.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>It is doubtful whether the orders of these two Councils
were ever acted upon. In any case, not even the most
well-intentioned reform of their procedure could make
the episcopal courts satisfactory for the trial of heresy.
The bishops are repeatedly urged to bestir themselves
even on pain of deprivation.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> The fact was that some
special machinery had to be devised. On the other hand,
the authorization of the system of Inquisition was of the
utmost importance. It was fully recognized by Innocent
III, who in his Decretals carefully distinguished it from
the two other judicial methods of <i>accusatio</i> and <i>denuntiatio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a>
Innocent was not thinking only, or perhaps mainly, of
heresy in introducing a new judicial method—but of
clerical reform. Even when the offence of a prelate was
a matter of common notoriety it was difficult to bring
the crime home to him when the system of <i>accusatio</i>
required the concurrence of seventy-two witnesses. That
system sheltered the high in office; and it was therefore,
from the reformer’s point of view, defective. The greatest
of the popes had given his imprimatur to a system, which
beginning in the ecclesiastical courts, was, owing to its
manifest advantages, destined to make a triumphal
progress in the temporal courts also, eventually supplanting
the system of <i>accusatio</i> altogether.</p>

<p>The definite starting-point of the Inquisition has been
attributed to many dates. One enthusiast went as far back
as Creation, finding the first inquisitor in the Almighty
Himself, and successors to Him in Jacob, Saul, David,
Eli, Jesus Christ, John the Baptist and St. Peter among
others.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> Less ambitious authorities, content to go no
further back than the Middle Ages, have discovered the
starting-point in the legatine commission entrusted by
Innocent III to Pierre de Castelnau, Arnaud of Citeaux
and their colleagues.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> Whether they, with their lieutenant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
St. Dominic, were inquisitors or not turns on the interpretation
of the word.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> In the loose general sense of
searchers out, certainly they were—as others had been
before them. The plain fact is, there were inquisitors
before the Inquisition existed. But in the strict technical
sense of officers of a tribunal specifically set apart for
jurisdiction over heresy, they clearly were not.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> The
tribunal of the Inquisition was not in existence in the
pontificate of Innocent III. On the other hand, we have
by this time advanced a considerable distance on the road
to the formation of a new tribunal. Heresy has been
recognized as so dangerous as to justify the organization
of a crusade against it. The bishops’ courts have been
found so defective in dealing with heresy that the device
has been adopted of sending special commissioners to
try to do what they have failed to do. The method of
judicial procedure by <i>inquisitio</i> in place of <i>accusatio</i> has
been officially approved. It wants but one other step
to bring us to the foundation of the permanent delegacy
for the prosecution of heretical pravity, which is the
Inquisition.</p>

<p>This step was taken by Pope Gregory IX, who may
therefore legitimately be said to have founded the Inquisition.
Both the episcopal courts and the experiment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>the occasional legate had been insufficient. Gregory
made use of a powerful weapon which came readily to
hand in the two great Mendicant Orders. Recognizing
their potential utility, Gregory, herein followed by
Innocent IV, showered upon them all manner of special
privileges and exemptions and bound them by this means
peculiarly to the service of the papacy. They were pre-eminently
fitted, as it happened, for the special service
of prosecuting heresy. They were still young in the first
white heat of a new enthusiasm, while their zeal and their
purity made them both influential and popular. They
were also often endowed—especially the Dominicans—with
high intellectual gifts and early acquired a great
reputation as subtle and learned theologians. Thus
while their poverty, their single-mindedness and their
good works were an answer to anti-sacerdotal attacks,
their theological attainments enabled them to combat the
dialectical arguments of the heterodox. The uniformity
and permanence of inquisitorial practice came largely
from the selection of the two orders of the Friars to undertake
the jurisdiction over heresy. In so far, therefore,
as the choice of a particular date or incident for the
commencement of an institution can be otherwise than
arbitrary, it is legitimate to fix upon the delegation by
Gregory IX of jurisdictional powers almost exclusively
to the members of the Franciscan and Dominican orders
as marking the beginning of the Inquisition as an
organized tribunal.</p>

<p>Actually the first delegation made by Pope Gregory
in regard to heresy was made neither to a Franciscan nor
a Dominican, but to a man notorious for his extraordinary
relations with Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, namely
Conrad of Marburg. Whatever his status to begin with,
he certainly became a delegate possessed of very wide
powers eventually. He was in fact an inquisitor in
precisely the same sense as Pierre de Castelnau and
Arnaud of Citeaux had been inquisitors; and the
question of his precise authority has exactly the same
bearing on the question of the beginnings of the tribunal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
of the Inquisition as the question of <i>their</i> authority—no
more.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></p>

<p>Eight days after the bestowal of the commission upon
Conrad, namely on June 20, 1227, Gregory entrusted
another inquisitorial commission to a Dominican. This,
however, is not the significant date. The decisive event
is the addressing of two bulls to France in April 1233,
the first to the bishops, the second to the Preaching
Friars. The first explains that owing to ‘the whirlwind
of cares’ and ‘the presence of overwhelming anxieties,’
under which the bishops labour, the Pope has thought
it well to divide their burdens and has decided to send
the Preaching Friars against the heretics of France. The
bishops are earnestly exhorted to treat the Brothers
kindly and lend them all assistance in the fulfilment of
their office. The second, and by far the more important
bull, addressed to the Friars, empowers them ‘to deprive
clerks of their benefices for ever, and to proceed against
them and all others without appeal, calling in the aid of
the secular arm if necessary, and coercing opposition,
if needful, with the censures of the Church, without
appeal.’<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> Some have detected in these bulls an apologetic
tone indicating uncertainty on Gregory’s part as to
whether the bishops would acquiesce in this invasion of
their powers, and it is also no doubt true that ‘the
character of his instructions proves that he had no conception
of what the invasion was to lead to.’<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>other hand, there is here the clear evidence of a matured
conception, based upon the experience of the multiplication
of special commissions to individual legates, of
a permanent delegation.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> By 1235 this system had
penetrated not only through France, Toulouse and
Burgundy, but also Lombardy, Sicily, Aragon, Brabant,
Germany.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></p>

<p>The inquisitorial commissions entrusted to the Friars,
it is important to note, did not involve the extinction of
episcopal jurisdiction in matters of heresy. In 1234
Gregory is found threatening the bishops of the province
of Narbonne, if they do not show due energy against
heretics, and making no mention of the new authority.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a>
As yet the friars-inquisitor are regarded only as a
more efficient supplement to the ordinary ecclesiastical
tribunals. Gregory intended that bishops and inquisitors
should work together, and bishops had to concur in the
friars’ sentences. Plainly there was not unnatural
antagonism, bishops wishing to treat inquisitors simply as
expert advisers, inquisitors aiming at becoming the real
judges. In 1247 Innocent IV treats the bishops as the real
judges: yet in the numerous sentences of the celebrated
inquisitor, Bernard de Caux, recorded between 1246 and
1248, there is no trace of episcopal concurrence.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> In 1248
the Council of Valence had to bring pressure upon bishops
to observe the sentences of inquisitors.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> Between 1250 and
1254 the director of the proceedings of the Carcassonne
Inquisition who makes the interrogations and imposes
the sentences is a bishop: but it is not certain whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>he was acting in his episcopal capacity or as a special
papal commissioner. Such commissions were rarely given
to bishops, as the popes much preferred, as a rule, to
use the friars. The root fact was that to perform his
special duties efficiently an inquisitor needed to devote
his entire time and attention to them: and thus, as it
became more and more apparent that heresy was no
mere ephemeral menace which could be stamped out
once for all, but a lasting trouble which had constantly
to be met, so the Inquisition, first regarded as a temporary
expedient to deal with an emergency, developed into a
permanent institution. So also the efforts of the bishops,
either to retain the jurisdiction over heresy in their own
ordinary courts or to superimpose their authority over
the inquisitor in his extraordinary court, were alike
doomed to failure. As a matter of fact, probably the
average bishop was too much immersed in other cares
and interests to trouble to secure his prerogative in the
matter of heresy.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> Thus it was that before the end of
the thirteenth century the Inquisition had come to
be an intrinsic part of the judicial organization of the
Church.</p>

<p>The pontificate of Gregory IX is in more ways than
one a critical period in the history of the repression of
heresy. It saw the first clear authorization of the death
penalty for the obdurate heretic. Capital punishment
had at times been shown to be the popular remedy for
heresy; it had sometimes been adopted by the secular
arm, sometimes approved by the clergy. But it had not
been legalized in the empire, formally sanctioned by the
temporal law of the world, as the general rule of Christendom.
The first public law of Europe enjoining it was
the work of the Emperor Frederick II. That the most
extraordinary member of the house of Hohenstaufen,
being a man who despite a curious strain of superstition
in him was a rationalist and a sceptic, should have been
responsible for this legislation may at first sight appear
astonishing. An Italian, not a German, brought up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>among the half Greek, half Saracen influences of Sicily,
drawing his inspiration rather from Averrhoës and Arab
free-thought than from any Christian source, amazingly
versatile, poet, lover of learning, statesman, diplomatist,
his outlook upon the world was altogether individual,
his intellect powerful and singular, untrammelled by
convention. He was a medley of strange contradictions:
he protected Jews and Mussulmans; he persecuted
heretics. The Averrhoïst heretics from Islam interested
him, the heretics from Catholicism not at all.</p>

<p>On November 22, 1220, Frederick produced his first
constitution for Lombardy.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> This repealed the penalties
of Frederick Barbarossa in his edict of 1184, confiscation
of property and outlawry, penalties severe enough,
because outlawry in the Middle Ages was a terrible
punishment, putting the culprit at any man’s mercy.
This first constitution appears to have been inspired by
Honorius III.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> A second constitution of March 1224,
published at Catania for the whole of Lombardy, first
introduced the death penalty—death at the stake; but
at the discretion of the judge, the loss of the tongue
might be substituted.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> In 1231 in the Constitutions of
Melfi, which applied indeed only to Sicily, this element of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>choice was no longer included, and the penalty was made
absolutely death by fire. In 1238 this regulation was
extended to the empire, being afterwards introduced
into the Sachenspiegel and Schwabenspiegel of Germany.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a>
Thus death by fire became the recognized punishment
for heresy in the empire. In 1226 Louis IX issued
ordinances prescribing severe punishments for heretics;
but at the time the use of the stake was general in France,
and it was formally accepted as the legal punishment in
the <i>Etablissements</i> of Louis IX in 1270.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p>

<p>In view of what Frederick II did in his Constitutions,
some historians have placed upon his shoulders the full
responsibility for the horrors of the stake. This is both
unfair and unhistorical. The blame attaches to no
single man. The fact of first giving sanction in civil law
to death by burning is certainly important, but the importance
can easily be exaggerated. Frederick was only
giving legal recognition to the actual practice of France
and Germany; only introducing what was customary
elsewhere into Italy, where tolerance had on the whole
been general. Some importance should also be attached
to the revival of the study of Roman Law, which showed
that Manichæans had suffered death in days before
Constantine. In the part played by Frederick II we shall
be wise to recognize not something catastrophic but
rather a link among very many in a lengthy chain of
development.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> Nor must we forget the significance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>the order that burnings are to take place ‘in conspectu
populi.’ This is surely an answer to a popular demand
that the execution of heretics should be made a public
example, a salutary spectacle? The examination of the
force of public opinion is almost always more fruitful
than that of the motives of individuals, however powerful.</p>

<p>What was the attitude of the Church in its crusade
against heresy towards the action of Frederick? Being
crucial, the question is exceedingly controversial. There
have been apologists for the Church who have argued that
the whole blame for the burning of heretics rests with
the secular power, that Gregory IX had a positive aversion
to the idea, that Frederick II’s laws against heretics
are to be regarded as an attempt to humiliate the Pope
and wrest from the Church jurisdiction which properly
belonged to it. This argument makes the establishment
of the Inquisition a measure of self-defence, a strategic
blow delivered in the great war between the secular and
ecclesiastical authorities.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></p>

<p>This ingenious theory will not stand close examination.
There is in the first place the <i>prima facie</i> probability that
an unorthodox emperor, anxious to utilize the question
of heresy in a conflict with the papacy, would rather
protect than prosecute it. In the second place, there is
really no evidence for discovering in Frederick’s action
an elaborate Machiavellian device; while we have
sufficient evidence that Gregory did approve the burning
of heretics.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> There seems clearly to have been clerical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>influence behind the constitutions. The constitution of
1224 has been ascribed to the influence of a certain German
prelate, Albert, Archbishop of Magdeburg, imperial
legate in Italy, who wanted to see heretics treated in
Italy as they were in his own country, and who therefore
induced the emperor to give legal sanction to the death
penalty.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> Even more significant would appear to have
been the part played by the Spanish Dominicans, Guala
and Raymond of Peñaforte. Guala was Bishop of
Brescia in 1230, and Brescia was the first town to place
among its municipal laws the Lombard Constitution of
1224. The Bishop was in constant communication with
Gregory, and when Rome followed the example of
Brescia, it is surmised, though it cannot be proved, that
Guala was responsible for this, as also for the Constitution
of 1231.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> This is conjecture, and so is the alternative
theory which attributes the legal establishment of the
death sentence not so much to Guala as to Raymond.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a>
Whatever may be the truth concerning clerical influence
prior to the promulgation of the Constitutions, the
question of the subsequent attitude of the Church towards
them is not a matter of conjecture.</p>

<p>In his bull, <i>Excommunicamus</i>, Gregory orders that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>heretics, condemned by the Church, shall be handed over
to the secular arm and punished by the merited penalty
(‘puniantur animadversione debita’). What this punishment
is, is not expressly mentioned, but inasmuch as
all other possible penalties are mentioned by name—imprisonment,
excommunication, infamy, deprivation of
civil rights etc., we are left by a process of elimination
with the death penalty as the only conceivable end for
the obdurate heretic abandoned to the secular arm.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a>
Only wilful blindness can misinterpret the phrase
‘animadversione debita,’ especially as its meaning seems
to be forcibly illustrated by the practice of the Senator
Annibaldi who ruled Rome in Gregory’s name. In 1231
he issued a decree, introducing the imperial constitution
into the city and establishing that each senator, on
admission into office, must pronounce the ban of the city
against all heretics in it, seize upon all who are pointed
out as heretics by the inquisitors and punish them within
eight days from the passing of sentence. Here Annibaldi
used the Pope’s euphemism, ‘merited penalty.’ The
same year several heretics were seized in Rome, some
imprisoned, but the obdurate burnt.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></p>

<p>If it may still be felt that there is some doubt regarding
the personal feeling of Gregory IX about Frederick II’s
action, there can be no doubt at all as to his successor,
Innocent IV, who gave complete pontifical sanction to
the Constitutions by inscribing them <i>in extenso</i> in a bull
entitled <i>Cum adversus haereticam pravitatem</i>, issued in
1245.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a></p>

<p>The Church did more than simply give its formal
approval to secular legislation against heresy: it saw to
it that the lay authority put its legislation into practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>It was for the Church to seek out, arrest, examine and
condemn the heretic; it was the function of the State to
free the Church from the guilt of blood by arranging
for the actual execution of the impenitents, the canon
thus being reconciled with harsh necessity. Apportionment
of its duties in the matter of heresy to the State by
the Church was no new thing in the days of Gregory and
Innocent. The resolutions of earlier councils had referred
significantly to the danger of popular revolutions, did not
the secular authority play its part, and had threatened
that disobedient lords might find their lands and goods
given away to others more zealous or more prudent.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a>
The decree of Verona (1184) had claimed excommunication
as the penalty for failure to execute the imperial
laws (at that time those of Barbarossa) against heretics;
and the Fourth Council of the Lateran, enjoining an oath
upon all secular rulers that they will banish all heretics
from their lands, declares their vassals to be absolved
from fidelity in the case of non-compliance.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></p>

<p>Already, before the days of Innocent IV, it had been
made perfectly plain that the Church not only desired
and expected the execution by the secular authority of its
own laws against heretics, but that it was prepared to use
all available means to compel it to do so. Innocent IV
placed the coping-stone upon this system by his famous
bull issued to all the lay rulers of Italy in 1252, known as
<i>Ad extirpanda</i>.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> This bull is remarkable for the thorough
and systematic nature of its provisions. To the end
that the pest of heresy may be uprooted, all lay rulers
are to swear to carry out the laws against heresy on
pain of fine and of being held an infamous perjuror and
fautor of heretics.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> Every civil magistrate within three
days of his entrance into office is to appoint twelve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>good Catholics, two notaries, two senators, two friars from
the Prædicants, two from the Brothers Minor, whose
duties are to search out heretics, seize their goods and
hand them on to the bishop. These officials are to enjoy
a variety of privileges and to be free from all interference
in their work. The civil magistrate is to hand over all
heretics within a fortnight of their capture either to the
bishop or the inquisitors.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> Those condemned are within
five days of sentence to be dealt with by the secular arm
in accordance with the Constitutions (of Frederick II).
The secular authority is also required to inflict torture
on those heretics who refused to confess or inculpate their
confederates, to see to the exaction of fines and destruction
of heretics’ houses, to keep lists of those defamed of heresy.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a>
These statutes, and all others which might subsequently
be added against heresy, are to be religiously preserved
in the statute-books of every city, on pain of excommunication
for any non-compliant official, of interdict for any
recalcitrant city. No attempt must be made to alter
these laws or to observe any other laws which may be
found to be in contradiction to them.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></p>

<p>Various slight alterations and modifications were
subsequently made in the terms of this all-important
fulmination. But with only insignificant revisions it
was reissued by Alexander IV in 1259, and in 1265 by
Clement V, who, however, inserted the word ‘inquisitor’
in places where previously only bishops and friars had
been designated. In the main the bull remained unaltered,
a lasting monument both to the Church’s power in that
age and of its attitude towards secular action with regard
to heresy. It was for the Church to command where
her interests were concerned; she expected to be obeyed
and, in case of defiance, had the necessary force to compel
obedience. Excommunication and interdict in those days
were no empty words. To be placed outside the communion
of the Church was even more than being outlawed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>from the Empire, equivalent to being placed outside
civilization; it was to be deprived of all rights, made any
man’s legitimate prey. And if excommunication was
more injurious to the simple citizen than to the prince
or noble, still the latter had much to fear. The ban of
the Church relieved his vassals from their allegiance and
was an invitation to his enemies to march to his despoil.
In the eyes of the believer excommunication entailed
something very much worse than even such material
trouble and loss; it meant the exclusion from the greatest
of means to salvation on earth, the imperilling of salvation
in eternity.</p>

<p>There was, as a matter of fact, no reluctance on the
part of the state to the task of persecuting heretics, as
the secular legislation of Henry II of England, Barbarossa,
Alfonso II and Pedro II of Aragon abundantly testifies.
But few secular magistrates would be willing to incur so
great a material and spiritual risk as excommunication
merely for the sake of a few fanatical schismatics.</p>

<p>The argued justification of the now well-established
system of persecution, of which <i>Ad extirpanda</i> is the
coping-stone, we find in Thomas Aquinas. In the
Church’s procedure in respect of heretics he sees proof of
her deep mercy and charity. Her aim is the retrievement
of the prodigal, his penitence and return to the fold.
She aims not at punishment, but forgiveness. For the
penitent all is well, only for the obdurate and those who
have relapsed after reconciliation is there punishment.
It is meet that these should suffer, for in her kindness to
the individual the Church must not jeopardize the welfare
of the whole community. Heresy is the most terrible
of all offences. To corrupt the faith is a far worse crime
than to corrupt the coinage.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> The latter is an aid to our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>temporal existence, the former an absolute necessity for
the eternal life of the soul. If then the coiner be deemed
worthy of death, how much more the heretic! The
argument of analogy is fortified by the text of Scripture.
The methods of the Inquisition are found to be justified
by Christ’s words: ‘If a man abide not in me, he is cast
forth as a branch, and is withered, and they shall gather
them and cast them into the fire and they are burned.’
Thus the sayings of the Founder of Christianity were
made to sanction a system of cruelty utterly abhorrent
to the whole tenor of His teaching.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER III - THE SPREAD OF THE INQUISITION
THROUGH EUROPE</h3>

<p>By the willing labours of the two Mendicant orders the
Inquisition was introduced into most of the countries
of Europe during the course of the thirteenth century.
Sometimes the two co-operated, as for example
in Aragon, Navarre, Burgundy and Lorraine. But there
was a good deal of jealousy between them, and sometimes
friction, so that it was generally found expedient to assign
Franciscans and Dominicans to different areas. Thus
the former were given the eastern portion of France south
of the Loire; the latter the western. Italy was also
divided, each order being allotted carefully defined districts
by Innocent IV in 1254. Northern France, Germany
and Austria were entrusted to Dominicans; eastern
countries, Bohemia and Dalmatia, to Franciscans.</p>

<p>The tribunal met with varying measures of success
in the different countries of Europe, and in early days
encountered considerable opposition and other difficulties
in each.</p>

<p>In Languedoc the way for the Inquisition had been
well prepared by the Albigensian Crusade: yet even
so it was far from smooth. The zealous proceedings
of Guillem Arnaud and his assistants provoked the
bitterest popular resistance.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> An assistant, Ferrer, was
expelled from Narbonne; Arnaud himself from Toulouse.
But his unconquerable spirit, assisted by Gregory IX’s
support, triumphed over popular hatred. Particularly
in 1241 and 1242 the inquisitors were exceedingly active,
so much so that in desperation certain Cathari set upon
Arnaud and several others and did them to death. Not
by such means could the Inquisition be worsted. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>Count of Toulouse, who had been planning to reassert
his independence, was forced to become completely
reconciled to the papacy, and as an outward and visible
sign of submission to take up arms against his own subjects
by besieging the last fortress of Catharism in the land,
the fortress of Montségur. The fall of Montségur and
the holocaust of heretics which followed it, together
with improved organization, enabled the Inquisition
to make better headway. A new difficulty, however,
arose in 1290 in the shape of strong protests against
the alleged cruelties and injustices of two inquisitors,
Nicholas d’Abbeville and Fulk de Saint-Georges. The
complaint that Nicholas had condemned the innocent
and wrung false confessions by cruelty was laid before
Philip IV. There was particularly strong feeling aroused
by the posthumous proceedings taken against a noted
citizen of Carcassonne, a great friend of the Franciscans,
named Fabri, who was accused of having been hereticated
on his death-bed. The defence of Fabri’s memory
was undertaken by a remarkable man, a Franciscan,
named Bernard Délicieux. The inquisitors represented
Délicieux as a deliberate adversary of their tribunal;
but when in 1301 Philip sent two representatives into
Languedoc to inquire into the causes of trouble, they
called to their assistance the resolute Franciscan, who
suggested the suspension of the inquisitors pending
investigation. The case was argued out before the King,
who came to the conclusion that the complaint had been
justified, that the inquisitors had been guilty of grave
excesses, of lawless exactions and the manipulation of
evidence, and took the unprecedented step of removing
both Nicholas d’Abbeville and Fulk de Saint-Georges.
At the same time he deprived the inquisitors of the right
to make arbitrary arrests. Philip’s attitude towards
the activities of the tribunal in Languedoc was not based
upon principle, but was dependent upon the varying
circumstances of his quarrel with Boniface VIII. Thus
when, as at this time, French king and pontiff were
quarrelling, it was demonstrated that the Inquisition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
in France existed only on sufferance and that its peculiar
privileges, derived from the papacy, automatically
ceased during such disagreement. On the other hand,
in 1304, when a reconciliation between the combatants
had been effected, a compromise was arranged: whereby
it was settled that royal officials should give every
assistance to the inquisitors, when called upon to do
so; but on the other hand these officials were to visit
the inquisitorial prisons, and to prevent abuses, and
independent action on the part of inquisitors without the
co-operation of the bishops was to cease.</p>

<p>It was not long before complaints against the
Inquisition were renewed—the most important charge
being that good Catholics were forced into pleading
guilty to heresy by the use of torture and imprisonment.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a>
This time an appeal was made to the Pope, Clement V,
who sent two cardinals to investigate at Carcassonne
and Bordeaux.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> They seem to have discovered many
abuses in the management of the prisons and to have
become satisfied of the genuineness of some at any rate
of the allegations against the tribunal; and Clement
made a praiseworthy attempt at reform. In 1312
the Council of Vienne<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> issued a number of canons to
this end, known as Clementines, which required that
in the infliction of torture the inquisitors must have
the concurrence of the bishop, also in the supervision
of prisons. Excommunication was threatened against
any who should abuse his power in order to satisfy
personal animus or greed. The restrictions imposed
on inquisitorial action by the Clementines were most
bitterly resented by the great inquisitor Bernard Gui.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>With the death of Clement such vexation disappeared.
The Clementines were indeed republished by John XXII,
but it was at once clear that he had no desire to interfere
with the Inquisition. The feeling of freedom enjoyed
by the Inquisition in Languedoc is evidenced by its
triumph over its former enemy, Délicieux. During the
days of Pope Clement he had been suffered to live in
peace; now he was charged with having impeded justice
and with having compassed the death of Benedict XI
by poison. Overcome by repeated tortures, he threw
himself upon the mercy of the court; found guilty
on the first charge, he was condemned to perpetual
imprisonment. This event in 1319 marked the victory
of the Inquisition in Languedoc. Now without fear
of opposition it could prosecute its labours in persecution,
systematized, unremitting, relentless. Heresy
was extirpated, the finishing touch to the Albigensian
Crusades supplied, and the distinctive features of south-eastern
France, as far as possible, blotted out. The irony
of the situation is that in accelerating this process the
Inquisition was unconsciously assisting the aggrandizement
of the royal power of France, with whose centralizing
policy the existence of so powerful an independent
tribunal was eventually found to be incompatible.</p>

<p>The beginnings of the attempt to extirpate heresy
north of the Loire are associated with the hated name
of Robert le Bugre who, armed with a somewhat vague
authority from Gregory IX, is found active from the
year 1233 in La Charité, Péronne, Cambrai, Douai, Lille,
his aim—it has been said—‘not to convert but to burn.’<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a>
He aroused the jealousy of the bishops, who informed
the Pope that heresy was non-existent in their provinces.
The results of Robert’s enthusiastic labours convinced
Gregory that the episcopal assurances had been misleading,
that heresy was in reality rampant, so that he
entrusted his delegate with a special commission and
ordered the bishops to support him. Thus fully
recognized, the inquisitor traversed Flanders, Champagne,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>
<p>Burgundy in a passion of religious energy, finding many
victims and producing widespread consternation. But his
career was a short one: found guilty of numerous excesses,
he was deprived of his commission and relegated to prison.</p>

<p>After this we do not hear of holocausts. There
was, in reality, little heresy in northern France, and
the Dominicans, to whom the scouring of heretics in
the country was entrusted, had not a great deal to do.
Their labours, however, received the whole-hearted
support of Louis IX, who liberally supplied them with
money; their tribunal was well organized, the officers
vigilant. The first <i>auto-da-fé</i> recorded to have taken
place in Paris occurred in May, 1310, when a woman
called Marguerite la Porète was the principal victim.
She had written a book, the thesis of which was that
the sanctified soul could without sin satisfy all the
cravings of the flesh. Her followers would appear to
have been the chief prey of French inquisitors in the
latter part of the century.</p>

<p>There are illustrations during this period of the
efficacy of the Inquisition even against powerful personages,
most notably perhaps Hugh Aubryot, <i>prévôt</i>
of Paris<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> and builder of the Bastille, who, incurring the
animosity of the University of Paris, found himself
brought up on a flimsy charge and condemned to perpetual
imprisonment; but in France the Inquisition
did not rest on very secure foundations. It might be
useful when heresy was rife and the proceedings of
inquisitorial confiscations brought money into the royal
exchequer; but success in coping with heresy, that is
to say efficiency on the part of the tribunal, rendered
it no longer an object of solicitude to the crown.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></p>

<p>By far the most notable fact concerning the Inquisition
in France was its dependence on the crown. An
interesting illustration of its subordination was given
in 1322, when the tribunal absolved a certain abbot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>from the charge of heresy. The <i>procureur-général</i> was
not satisfied with this finding and appealed against it,
not to the Pope, but to the Parlement. The matter was
one clearly coming within the province of a spiritual,
not a temporal court, yet the Parlement calmly assumed
jurisdiction at the instance of the royal officer. A yet
more outstanding case arose in 1330, when Philip sent
a representative, de Villars, to redress encroachments
by ecclesiastical courts upon royal courts in Toulouse.
Being ordered to produce his registers by de Villars,
the inquisitor of Toulouse appealed not to the Pope
but to the King. In 1334 Philip, making known his
royal pleasure that inquisitors shall enjoy their ancient
privileges, makes it clear that they are to be regarded
as derivative from the crown. The inquisitor is looked
upon as a royal official.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> The two most noteworthy
inquisitorial trials in France were both of a political
nature, the state making use of inquisitorial machinery
for its own ends, those of the Templars and Jeanne
d’Arc. The great Schism, and still more the Pragmatic
Sanction of Bourges, by weakening the hold of the papacy,
enlarging the independence of the Gallican Church, and
aggrandizing the Parlement still further weakened the
position of the Inquisition. Not only the Parlement
but the University of Paris was a formidable antagonist
and rival. The latter arrogating to itself a supremacy
in theological matters, regarding itself as arbiter in all
matters of doctrinal speculation, acquired the authority
which the Inquisition lost. The tribunal was still active
in the fifteenth century, but it was finding the question
of expenses a difficult problem, and the growth of indifference
to the penalty of excommunication made its
task harder. An effort was made by Nicholas V in 1451
to restore the former powers of the Inquisition and a
wide definition was given to its authority. In France,
however, it had lost too much in prestige to allow of
its being revivified.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> When Protestantism entered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>country in the sixteenth century it was not the Inquisition
that was employed against it, but the University of Paris
and the so-called <i>chambre ardente</i> of the Parlement—national
institutions under royal control. The days of
the Inquisition in France were over.</p>

<p class="tb">The history of the Inquisition in Germany opens
with the careers of Conrad of Marburg and Conrad Tors,
who carried on a fanatical crusade against Waldenses
and different pantheist sects, of which the Amaurians
and Luciferans were the chief, the methods of their persecution
being purely arbitrary and leaving the accused
practically no opportunity of defence. Conrad of
Marburg’s execrated existence was terminated by his
murder in 1233.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> That inquisitors were working in
Germany through the latter part of the thirteenth century
we know; but they do not appear to have accomplished
much. After the publication of the Clementines, however,
new efforts were made to suppress the Beghards
and similar unauthorized associations, but the work
seems to have been carried out rather by episcopal courts
than by friars specially deputed by the pope. It was
not until 1367 that, with the appointment by Urban V
of two Dominicans, a thorough attempt was made to
organize the papal inquisition in Germany. Pressure
was brought to bear upon the Emperor Charles IV,
and in 1369 he issued edicts extending the fullest possible
authority to the papal delegates with a view to the
eradication of the Beghards. Under threat of severe
punishment all prelates were enjoined to obey the orders
of the inquisitors with a good grace, while in order that
their privileges might be secured certain high nobles
were appointed to protect the inquisitors and to deal with
any complaints they might make. Later on, Charles IV
entrusted the Inquisition with a new power, that of
censorship, for the Beghards derived much of their
influence from the circulation of pamphlets in the
vernacular.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>
<p>Fortified by the imperial favour, Kerlinger, the
principal delegate, displayed great energy at Magdeburg,
Erfurt, Mühlhausen, etc.; and notwithstanding the
occasional opposition of a jealous episcopate the
Inquisition had made such good progress by 1372
that it had apparently succeeded in driving its enemies
out of northern and central Germany. These were the
days of the Flagellants and of the dancing mania as well
as of Beghards and the Brethren of the Free Spirit.
There certainly seemed to be no less need of organized
repression; nevertheless the Inquisition in Germany
after the days of Kerlinger tended to lose ground. Complaints
made against its recent proceedings were found
on investigation by Gregory XI to be well founded,
and the papal disapprobation armed the episcopate
against their rivals. As in France, so in Germany, the
Schism had the effect of still further reducing the influence
of the Inquisition. Persecution of Brethren of the Free
Spirit continued late into the fifteenth century: but
heresies far more formidable than the mystic antinomianism
which had been the characteristic heresy
of Germany were about to dawn. The intellectual
force in men such as Johann Wessel, Reuchlin and
Erasmus had infinitely greater power than a perverted
pantheism. And when Lutheranism took hold upon
Germany, there was no powerful Inquisition to check
it. Had there existed in Germany such a tribunal as
had stamped out Catharism in Languedoc, it might,
so far as we can tell, have succeeded in silencing Luther,
while he was still an unknown monk of Wittenberg,
before he had come to apprehend the full significance
and the ultimate developments of his famous theses.
But when the hour came of the Church’s greatest danger
from heresy in Germany, the weapon which it had used
with such tremendous effect in earlier days had been
hopelessly blunted.</p>

<p class="tb">The publication of Frederick II’s Constitutions
and the activities of Gregory IX introduced a new era<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
of intolerance into Italy, where apparently tolerance
had hitherto been the rule. Inquisitorial activity
started in Florence and in Rome; it was carried further
afield by several perfervid champions, of whom the
best known was Peter Martyr, the scene of whose labours
was first Milan, then Florence. In Florence persecution
had become so menacing that a formidable rising was
provoked. This was the occasion of Piero’s coming to
Florence, where he at once formed a company on the
model of one he had created in Milan for the protection
of Dominicans, giving it the title of the <i>Compagnia della
Fede</i>. The Florentine inquisitor, with this protection,
proceeded with his persecutions and a bloody conflict
was provoked, which was as much one between Guelph
and Ghibelline as between orthodox and heretic. Peter
Martyr led the banners of the faith with such good effect
that the forces of heresy were badly beaten and the
city reclaimed for Pope and Inquisition. He was next
engaged as inquisitor in Cremona and again in Milan.
Though there is no record of his proceedings there, that
he was as ardent a persecutor as before seems proved
by his assassination at Milan in 1252.</p>

<p>As a practical memorial of the martyr’s enthusiasm
a voluntary association similar to those which Piero
had himself founded in Milan and Florence was formed
among the upper classes of the principal Italian cities,
the name <i>crocesegnati</i> being given to them, for the
protection and assistance of inquisitors. As devoted
and determined a champion as even Peter Martyr had
been was found in Rainerio Saccone of Vicenza, who
undertook the task of combatting heresy in Lombardy,
where it was very strong owing to large migrations
from Languedoc. Reorganizing and strengthening the
Lombard Inquisition, he achieved considerable success
with the assistance of Innocent IV, who at this time
issued the bull <i>Ad extirpanda</i>.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> With the accession
of Alexander IV activity in Lombardy was still further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>increased. The number of inquisitors was doubled,
and Rainerio announced that hitherto he had shown
incomparable mildness, henceforth he would be rigorous.
The chief obstacle—a formidable one—to the complete
success of the tribunal in Lombardy was the power
of the two great Ghibelline nobles, Eccelin da Romano
and Uberto da Pallavicino, into whose territories not
even a determined inquisitor dared enter. A crusade
against the former, organized by Alexander, after varying
fortunes proved successful, and the March of Treviso,
hitherto closed to the Inquisition, was laid completely
open.</p>

<p>A yet greater success was achieved by the Holy
See in 1266, when Charles of Anjou triumphed over
the Ghibellines at Benevento and the kingdom of Sicily
passed into full obedience to the papacy. Two years
later the last of the Hohenstaufen in a futile attempt
to regain Italy for his house perished on the field of
Tagliacozzo, and with him the last chance of the imperial
faction. Uberto had espoused the cause of Conradin
and the young prince’s failure involved the downfall
of the Lombard noble. The story of the fortunes of
the Inquisition in Italy being largely that of the fortunes
of Guelph in the strife with Ghibelline, this Guelph
triumph naturally gave a great impetus to the Inquisition.
It had now practically no political obstacle to face, and
it immediately extended its operations into all Ghibelline
territories, and although there were occasional outbursts
against it, as in Parma in 1279, when the populace
attacked the convent of the Dominicans and burned the
registers of the Inquisition, still the setbacks were not
serious. Ghibelline districts were particularly attacked,
and it was said that in such centres it was impossible to
feel safe, as in the eyes of the Church Ghibelline was apt
to mean heretic.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> It should, on the other hand, be noted
that even during the period of the Inquisition’s greatest
ascendancy in Italy, there are instances of papal
lenity in mitigation of the full rigour of the tribunal’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>practice.<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> In certain parts of Italy the Inquisition
did not thrive as in Lombardy and the Papal States.
When Charles of Anjou established himself in the Neapolitan
kingdom, one of his first proceedings was to
plant the Inquisition there, and he gave it his own
personal assistance in prosecuting its labours. On the
other hand, it remained somewhat dependent on the
crown and did not enjoy the whole-hearted support of
the local magistrates. Perhaps more serious was the
natural obstacle presented by the mountainous character
of the country. In the island of Sicily the Inquisition
had at no time much influence.</p>

<p>In another Italian state the Inquisition never
succeeded in obtaining a thorough hold—Venice, ever
zealous for its independence of outside control. When
Gregory IX started his campaign against heresy, the
republic held aloof; the Constitutions of Frederick II
were not incorporated in its laws. Persecution indeed
existed and the ordinary bishop’s court existed as elsewhere
in Christendom; but the Council, a secular body,
maintained a supervision in cases of heresy. The
Inquisition was not permitted to enter, and in consequence
Venice became an asylum of refuge for heretics from
other parts of Italy. But in 1288 Nicholas V ordered
the <i>signoria</i> to respect the laws of Pope and Emperor
and facilitate the work of the Inquisitor of Treviso in
whose province Venice ought to come.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> According
to the recognized principles of the age the attitude of
the republic was indefensible. Venice, accordingly, gave
way, but was able to effect a compromise, whereby the
Inquisition was admitted, but on the other hand the
edicts, imperial and ecclesiastical, were still not placed
among the statutes of the city and the republic supervised
the financial arrangements, defraying the expenses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>of the inquisitors, but at the same time receiving the
profits of confiscations. Thus one of the most prolific
sources of inquisitorial abuses was cut off, and at the
same time the power of the purse retained supreme
control for the state, the imposition of such important
restrictions allowed the Inquisition no such prestige
in Venice as it enjoyed in Lombardy. We find it at
times being deliberately ignored by the <i>signoria</i>, and
by the middle of the fifteenth century it had almost
entirely lost such influence as it had possessed after
the compromise of 1288.</p>

<p>In spite of its obtaining only partial ascendancy
in certain states, the Inquisition achieved its purpose
in Italy with marked success. Catharism lasted longer
there than in Languedoc, being found in Piedmont
in the late years of the fourteenth century; but it was
harried energetically, and early in the next century it
was to all intents and purposes extinct. Waldensianism
lasted longer, having a much greater hold over the
country. In 1352 we find that the Waldensian Church
in Turin is flourishing and its numbers so great that
no attempt is made at concealment. Gregory XI made
special efforts to suppress the sect in Piedmont, but
without complete success. The next century saw another
strenuous effort made by Yolande, the regent of Savoy,
who with the co-operation of the inquisitor of Dauphiné
undertook a campaign for the extermination of the
Waldenses, all her officials being by the Duchess’s
orders placed at the disposal of the inquisitors. For a
time the persecuted in Savoy were under the aegis of
Louis XI’s protection; but on his death persecution was
carried on assiduously. In 1488 an attempt was made
to put down the Waldenses by force of arms, but the
18,000 men to whom the task was entrusted met with
a crushing defeat. The respite thus secured did not,
however, last long, and in 1510 we find the Inquisition
strengthened by the loan of troops by the secular power
and using every means in its power against the heretics.
In the Alpine valleys the sect was never stamped out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
by the Inquisition and remained in existence there until
the terrible Vaudois massacres of 1655. But as a result
of the persistent persecution, emigration on a considerable
scale was continually taking place, the majority of those
who took flight finding a refuge in Calabria and Apulia,
where the arm of the tribunal scarcely ever extended.</p>

<p>The great Schism was disastrous in weakening the
respect felt in Italy not only for the papacy, but the
Church as a whole, and the Inquisition inevitably suffered
in consequence.</p>

<p class="tb">The fame of the Inquisition in the Spanish peninsula
has been so great that it has almost wholly eclipsed its
fame anywhere else in Europe, and its history has been
in every way peculiar. It acquired an altogether unique
position there; enjoyed an extraordinary prestige and
unexampled success. It earned an undying notoriety.
It became, as nowhere else in Europe, a national institution,
closely identified with the monarchy, but also
popular, a possession of which the people were proud.
It was a terror to the foreigner; it made the name of
Spaniard feared all over the world. It had played a
great part in welding the Peninsula together, in driving
out alien elements, producing national homogeneity.
It played, then, a large part in Spanish history, and
obtained a very marked influence on the national mind
and character. But the Inquisition which is so famous
or infamous in Spain was the creation of Ferdinand and
Isabella. It was a quite distinctive institution, much
more monarchical than papal, and it was not directly
the offspring of the tribunals that had existed in the
Peninsula in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The most remarkable fact concerning the Spanish
Inquisition is that this country in which the Inquisition
most abundantly flourished, the country which won
for itself easy pre-eminence for its close fidelity to the
Church, its zealous and implacable intolerance of any
sort of dissent, was originally equally pre-eminent for
its tolerance. The ardour of persecution in Spain was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
not due to something ingrained in the national character;
it was to a very large extent the offspring of the methods
pursued by the Holy Office; and the deep implanting
of the Holy Office was due to deliberate policy on the
part of the Spanish monarchy from the days of Ferdinand
the Catholic and Isabella.<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> In the Middle Ages the
civilization of Spain was very largely Saracen. From
such sources south of the Pyrenees came that distinctive
culture of Languedoc, out of which heresy had so luxuriantly
sprung. From a non-Christian people came the
philosophy, the mediæval, astronomical, botanical knowledge,
the art and fancy and the industrial skill and
trading enterprise of the country. Moreover Jew and
Christian met and did business together. So long as such
intermingling of different races, religions, civilizations
continued the soil was not favourable to the success of
such an institution as the Holy Office. Heterogeneity
is productive of tolerance. The Inquisition’s day could
only come with the determination to drive out the other
elements and to make the Peninsula European in race,
Christian in religion and ideas. The success of that
policy had to wait for the union of the two crowns of
Aragon and Castile. Prior to that, the Inquisition
obtained success in Aragon only, being unknown in
Castile and Leon, while in Portugal, though there were
inquisitors in the country from 1576 onwards, they
appear to have been singularly inactive.</p>

<p>In Aragon<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> persecution was originally organized by
the state, both Alfonso II and Pedro II promulgating
severe legislation against heresy, though a sort of Inquisition,
consisting partly of clergy, partly of laity,
was established by a statute issued at Tarragona in
1233. The real beginnings of the Inquisition in Aragon
are, however, to be traced from the intervention of the
redoubtable Raymond of Peñaforte, a year or two after
this. He was instrumental in introducing members of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>own order to deal with heresy; and in 1238 Gregory IX
entrusted the prosecution of heretics to the Mendicant
orders in Aragon. In 1242 a very important Council
held at Tarragona formulated rules of procedure for
the guidance of inquisitors.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> The Aragonese Inquisition
did not, however, show great activity until the opening
of the fourteenth century. Its activity then produced
popular protest, and in 1325 the Cortes, with the royal
assent, prohibited inquisitorial methods of torture. It is
doubtful if this was intended to apply to ecclesiastical
as well as lay courts. If it was, it had no lasting results,
as can be seen from Eymeric’s ‘Directorium.’<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a></p>

<p>This very remarkable inquisitor assumed office in
Aragon about 1360. With the most genuine and most
exalted conceptions of the dignity and importance of
his position, he put forward the utmost claims for the
Holy Office; yet from the internal evidence of his treatise
itself, it does not seem to have flourished in Aragon in
his day. He makes loud complaints of its poverty.
But the fact that so little came into its exchequer from
confiscations and that so ardent and active an inquisitor
should apparently have accomplished so little seems
mainly to prove that heresy was not a serious menace
in Aragon at this time.</p>

<p>In the next century the history of the Aragonese
Inquisition is neither interesting nor important, and the
end of that period brings us to the era of Torquemada
and the organization of a great Inquisition for the united
kingdoms of Spain.</p>

<p class="tb">In Eastern Europe<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> the Inquisition never succeeded
in obtaining much of a foothold. The main stronghold
of Catharism was in lands east of the Adriatic, but here
the papacy possessed but scant authority. A practically
abortive attempt was made to deal with the heretics
in 1202; but in the twenties the Mendicants in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>untiring zeal, using Hungary as their base and with the
armed support of Calomar, Duke of Croatia and Dalmatia,
waged successful warfare against the Bosnian Cathari
until the retirement of the crusaders in 1239. Their
withdrawal meant that no effectual result was achieved,
and Catharism remained powerful not only in Bosnia,
but Dalmatia, Bulgaria, and Roumania. The bishops
of Bosnia found themselves compelled to leave the
country. In 1298 an attempt made by Boniface VIII,
to establish an Inquisition in the lands south of Hungary
from the Danube to Macedonia, came to nothing. But
in 1320 an inquisitor named Fabiano, with the assistance
of the king of Hungary, made some progress against
the heretics, and a further effort was made in 1336
by Dominicans with the co-operation of the Hungarian
king. Though in 1378 Urban V congratulated Louis of
Hungary and the friars on having restored two thousand
heretics to the fold, four years later that monarch himself
complains that practically all his subjects are Cathari,
good Catholics being very sparse in numbers.</p>

<p>In 1407 Sigismund made an attempt to establish
himself in Bosnia, his cause obtaining papal recognition
as a crusade against Turks and Manichæans; but his
attempt ended in failure. In 1432 an Observative
Franciscan, Giacomo della Marca, already well known
as a stalwart persecutor of heretics in Italy, embarked
upon a missionary enterprise in Slavonia, and is said by
his eloquence to have made numerous converts; but his
success was short-lived, as he was recalled by Sigismund
to help in the religious troubles of Bohemia. After the
days of Sigismund there was little chance of success for
missionary or inquisitor beyond the Adriatic. The flow
of the Ottoman advance swept over the Balkans, and
the Cathari were converted not to Catholicism but to
the faith of Islam.</p>

<p>The Inquisition did not make its appearance in
Bohemia until late, the first inquisitors being appointed
in 1318, when they were also appointed for Poland,
Cracow and Breslau. There is hardly any record of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
they did. In 1335 Benedict XII made fresh efforts,
and between 1350 and 1380 there was considerable
activity against heretics, but it was the activity of the
ordinary episcopal courts, not of a papal inquisition.
There was a large diffusion of Waldensianism in the
country; apparently early in the century there had been
a certain number of Luciferans. With the Church in
Bohemia in a low state of efficiency and the rise of the
anti-sacerdotal movement which led to Husitism, the
task of repression was a difficult one, and there was no
Inquisition. One of the causes of the indignation of the
Czechs at the treatment of Hus at Constance was the
fact that Bohemia had had virtually no experience of
the Inquisition and was ignorant of its methods and
procedure.</p>

<p>After the silencing of the two great heresiarchs, the
Council commissioned the Bishop of Litomysl with
inquisitorial powers for the extirpation of heresy in
Bohemia; but as the Czechs were ravaging the Bishop’s
territories at the time he dared not show face. The next
expedient of the Council was the arrangement that
Husite heretics should appear before special inquisitors
in the Roman Curia. As it was in the highest degree
unlikely that any Husites, particularly after the fate of
Hus and Jerome, would quit their own country to answer
charges of heresy, this was a futile proceeding, as was
the next—a formal citation to 450 nobles, who had signed
a protest against the burning of Hus, to appear before the
Council on the charge of heresy. It was evident that no
Inquisition could exist in Bohemia as long as the country
remained rebellious, predominantly schismatic. The success
of the Inquisition invariably required the support
of popular opinion, magisterial acquiescence, or armed
force. Neither of the first two being forthcoming, the
last expedient had to be tried. A crusade was preached
against the heretic people, to which only one upshot was
anticipated. But the anti-Husite crusade ignominiously
failed, and the Czech people kept the Inquisition from
entering their borders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>In Scandinavian lands the Inquisition never penetrated,
and it only once, for a very brief period, made its
appearance in the British Isles. This was in connection
with the suppression of the Templars. At first when the
horrible accusations which led to the undoing of the great
military order were bruited about, Edward II refused to
credit them, the record of the order in England giving
no colour to the charges. When, however, Clement V
issued his bull, <i>Pastoralis praeeminentiae</i>, in which he
stated that the heads of the order had made confession
of the crimes imputed to the iniquitous knights, and
called upon the potentates of Europe to take action for
their suppression, the English king ordered the apprehension
of the Templars in England and the sequestration of
their property. No further action was taken. But in
September 1309 two papal commissioners, who had
been appointed more than a year previously, made their
appearance. Instructions were issued that all Templars
not yet seized should be brought to London, York, or
Lincoln, where the commissioners with the co-operation
of the bishops of the respective dioceses were
to hold inquiries. Similar orders were also dispatched
to Scotland and Ireland, where the inquisitors appointed
delegates. The proceedings in London began on October
20, 1309. The Templars, on examination, one
and all protested the innocence of the order; outside
witnesses, as a whole, gave the same testimony. The
object of the inquisitors being conviction, this was most
unsatisfactory. Progress was much better on the
Continent, where torture was employed; torture they
must use also in England, therefore. They obtained
from the King an order to the custodians of the prisons
to allow the inquisitors to do with the bodies of the
Templars what they pleased, in accordance with ecclesiastical
law.</p>

<p>Still only meagre results were obtained and Clement
became indignant. He wrote to Edward saying that he
had heard that he had refused the use of torture as being
contrary to the laws of his kingdom. No law could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
permitted to over-ride the canon law, and in interfering
with the work of the Inquisition the King had been
guilty of a very serious offence. He was offered remission
of sins if he would withdraw his prohibition of torture.
Thus urged, Edward again sanctioned the use of ‘ecclesiastical
law,’ but this time mentioned torture expressly,
explaining that he gave his sanction in deference to the
wishes of the Pope. Even thus the inquisitors could
not make headway. They were on alien soil in England;
the country took ill to the special tribunal and its
methods. All that they achieved was that the knights
eventually confessed themselves so ‘defamed’ for heresy
as to make it impossible for them to make the ‘canonical
purgation’ and therefore undertook to perform any
penances enjoined upon them. Such were the total
results attained by the Inquisition in England.</p>

<p>Persecution of heretics there had been before, under
the Assize of Clarendon; persecution in plenty there
was after, under <i>De Haeretico Comburendo</i> and in the
days of the Tudors; but the persecuting authority was
always the State—no such international, papally-controlled
tribunal as the Holy Office. Mary Tudor might
have achieved a large measure of success in her Romanist
policy had she been able to make more use of those
international agencies, of which Jesuit propaganda and
the Holy Office were the two chief, which provided the
sinews of the Counter-Reformation movement. As it
was, the British Isles remained free from inquisitorial
influence; their judicial customs and principles of justice
being uncontaminated by those methods of procedure
by <i>inquisitio</i>, by the use of torture, which the example
of the Holy Office introduced into so many civil courts
on the Continent.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV - THE COMPOSITION AND PROCEDURE
OF THE TRIBUNAL</h3>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>The popular fame that the Inquisition has gained is due
to the terror which it aroused in the days of its greatness;
its terror was the result of the thoroughness and efficiency
of its methods. It was efficient, in the first place, because
it was the product of experience. Its characteristics
were those that had been <i>proved</i> to be necessary. The
ordinary ecclesiastical courts had been found unsatisfactory
for dealing with heresy because their business
was too multifarious; the Inquisition was devoted to
the trial of one offence and one only. The bishops had
failed in part because they were not specially qualified
for their task; the inquisitors were trained specialists.</p>

<p>In the second place, the tribunal was strong in having
the support of the secular authority as well as of the
papacy behind it. Thirdly, it became widespread in
western Christendom, so that flight was a doubtful
salvation. It seemed ubiquitous, because the mutual
co-operation between inquisitors of different districts,
and indeed countries, was highly organized. It seemed
all-pervading because of its apparent omniscience, due
to the extensiveness of its records and the thoroughness
of its spy system. The victim, in short, was made to
feel his helplessness before a power which seemed as
strong and inexorable as fate.</p>

<p>The Inquisition owed much to the character of its
judges. They were, at any rate, enthusiastic and hard-working.
The half-hearted inquisitor was of rare occurrence.
They were often ardent with the fiery and
formidable zeal of fanaticism, believing themselves servants
of God and surrounded by that aureole of sanctity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
which gave their court the name and reputation of the
Holy Office. Often, beyond question they were cruel;
but, on the other hand, it is necessary to beware against
accepting the traditional idea of the inquisitor as typical.
In the Middle Ages, when he flourished, the inquisitor
was not popularly regarded as a man destitute of human
sympathy, an ogre; he was regarded, on the contrary,
with veneration. Often he was a man of high intellectual
attainments; practically always he must have been
educated and learned much beyond the ordinary; he
had studied in school and university and was a theologian,
if not also something of a philosopher and a lawyer.
Often too he was the most upright and honourable of
men; and it is plain that men like Bernard Gui and
Nicholas Eymeric had the highest sense of their responsibilities
and the loftiest ideals for their fulfilment.
Bernard Gui gives us a sketch of the ideal inquisitor.
He is a man ardent in the faith; never slothful, yet not
precipitate; never timid, but always cautious; never
credulous, but ever ready to listen; resolute for truth
and justice, yet merciful and compassionate; careful in
his sentences that no ground shall be given for the charge
of cruelty or rapacity.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></p>

<p>The inquisitor was a much privileged person, enjoying
a plenary indulgence during the whole period of office,
and he could only be excommunicated by the direct
authority of the Pope. In every way he was under the
panoply of special papal favour and protection. He had
the right of granting indulgences—this being mainly
used to encourage or reward witnesses and informants
against heretics.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> Privilege was also extended to all
assistants of the Holy Office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>The assistants were numerous, consisting of delegates,
often called vicars, <i>socii</i>, familiars, notaries, councillors,
prison officials and simple messengers and other servants.
To this list should be added the ordinary <i>curés</i>, whose
services might be utilized to publish citations, make
known the sentences of the tribunal, give testimony
for or against their own parishioners.</p>

<p>The delegates were assistants of the inquisitors; to
them was generally entrusted the task of asking preliminary
questions and hearing witnesses, the rôle of a <i>juge
d’instruction</i>. They thus relieved the inquisitors of most
of the burden of the initial and formal proceedings; but
they were strictly subordinates, their powers being carefully
stated in their commissions, and they were, as a
rule, appointed only for a particular cause and definite
period. On the other hand, they might take the
inquisitor’s place in case of his illness or absence from
any other unavoidable cause.</p>

<p>The <i>socius</i> was not, as his name seems to imply, a
colleague, but only a companion, who merely accompanied
the inquisitor on his journeyings in that capacity,
and discharged no official functions, save that he might
occasionally give informal advice.</p>

<p>The familiar, a most important and distinctive personage
of the tribunal, might come from any class of
society and usually came from men who lived in the
world. A recluse was of no use for the duties the familiar
had to perform. But once having adopted the calling
(valued on account of its ecclesiastical privileges), the
familiar became a member of a quasi-religious brotherhood.
His duties were various. A personal guard for
the inquisitor had to be provided. The inquisitors had
the right of arming familiars for this purpose, though
the Council of Vienne of 1311 recommended that the
number of familiars should be kept down to the minimum
and that the right of arming them should not be abused.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a>
Familiars also visited prisons, and at <i>autos-da-fé</i> had to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>accompany the condemned and the penitent, exhorting
them to unfeigned repentance, and encouraging them to
submit to the punishments inflicted upon them. Lastly,
and most important, the familiars were secret agents,
and were as a rule remarkably efficient spies.</p>

<p>Another important officer was the notary. He was
quite indispensable. The number of men qualified to fill
the post, in days when writing was not a widely diffused
accomplishment, was far from large; and the position
grew to be one held in high esteem and much sought
after. The notary’s main duty was to take down
interrogatories and answers, and to keep the register of
them. First of all he would take down rough notes and
afterwards he would make a fair copy on a parchment
for permanency. As the questions were put in the
vernacular and the register kept in Latin, he had to be
a translator as well as a clerk. His task was so heavy
that in some cases he was given the help of scriveners;
but every document had to bear his signature. It
would be impossible to exaggerate the significance of
this careful recording of evidence in the work of the
Inquisition. All the papers were sedulously kept; often
they were carefully indexed and annotated. In course
of time the registers came to form a wonderful repository
of information, which was of immense assistance to the
tribunal.</p>

<p>As an illustration of how the careful preservation
of exact and minute particulars of cases promoted the
success of the Holy Office may be taken the case of an
old woman apprehended in 1316. From the records it
was ascertained that the same woman had as far back
as 1268 confessed heresy and been reconciled. This
discovery showed that the prisoner was already a relapsed
heretic.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> The meticulous transcription of some casual
and apparently irrelevant remark made by a witness in
one case might lead to the arrest of an unsuspecting
citizen on the charge of heresy in quite a different part
of the world years afterwards.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>
<p>The councillors or experts—<i>viri boni</i> or <i>periti</i>—were
usually chosen from the ranks of the clergy, priests,
abbés, bishops—but they might also be laymen, and
were often civil lawyers. Thus, at Pamiers in 1329 we
find that out of fifty-one experts twenty are civil lawyers.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a>
The number of experts varied. Fifty is an exceptionally
large number; but twenty or twenty-five quite common.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a>
To what extent the councillors had a practical influence
in the inquisitorial process must remain doubtful. The
idea was that they should act as a check on irresponsible
inquisitors, as well as give professional legal opinion when
such was needed; and from the frequent references to
the system in papal bulls it certainly seems true that the
popes showed anxiety to encourage the system of expert
assistance as a restraint upon arbitrary action.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is by no means clear that the
system had much practical effect, since inquisitors were
not bound to accept the advice tendered, and the number
of the <i>periti</i> being so large, the volume of business
transacted usually so great, it is doubtful whether any
serious deliberation with the councillors took place in
the majority of cases. Probably their presence was
often purely formal, for the sake of giving additional
solemnity to the condemnation of heretics.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> Still, it
remains true that a place was provided in the inquisitorial
organization for the experts; that the means of competent
legal advice was forthcoming; that if the inquisitor was a
reasonable man he would no doubt pay due heed to such
advice on the purely legal aspect at all events of his
cases, and also that the experts, being often men of
importance, probably did have the power of making
their influence tell upon occasion. The system was at
all events a potential safeguard.</p>

<p>Finally, there must be mentioned, among the members
of the tribunal, one of the most important—the bishop.
The relations between bishops and inquisitors, frankly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>antagonistic in the early days of the Inquisition, probably
always tended to be unfriendly. If the bishop, for his
part, resented the new jurisdiction, which was a rival to
his own, the inquisitor in his own court aspired to be
supreme and to arrogate to himself a superiority over
the bishop, which the latter was not likely to allow.
The bishop’s position was not altogether easy. Required
to take cognizance of heresy in his own court, he yet
had also to officiate in the special court where the
inquisitor, whatever his ecclesiastical status and whatever
his pretensions, was bound to be always prime mover in
the proceedings. We know that the inquisitors often
acted without the co-operation of the bishop. The
relations between them remained none too clear until
they were regulated by the Council of Vienne. They
were to work together and to concur in the sentence.<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a>
As a matter of fact, the concurrence of the bishop was
apt to be a mere formality and his position in practice
was bound to be subordinate, the inquisitor being a delegate
expressly charged by the Pope with the duty of trying
heretics.</p>

<p>Such being the composition of the Inquisition, what
was the extent of its province? What, technically
speaking, was a heretic? According to Raymond of
Peñaforte, he was simply one who denied the faith. St.
Thomas Aquinas maintained that no one was a heretic,
unless he obstinately maintained an error after its
erroneousness had been pointed out to him by an
ecclesiastical authority. One teaching, therefore, was
that no one in ignorance could be a heretic.<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> Proof of
previous instruction in the truth had to be forthcoming
to show that a man was a heretic. But a broader
interpretation tended to prevail, and the heretic to be
considered as one who, on any grounds whatever, separated
himself from the traditional faith of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>mere fact of separation did not in itself constitute
heresy; but every schism must end in heresy, because
separation argues an error in belief touching the nature
of the Church. Lack of respect for ecclesiastical, and
especially papal, authority suggests denial of the faith.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a>
To assert anything against the Scriptures, to add to them
or subtract from them would be heresy. Certain forms
of blasphemy and profanity would make a man at least
suspect of heresy.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a></p>

<p>Obviously the matter of interpretation gave abundant
scope for casuistry. Bernard Gui’s ‘Practica’ is an
illustration of this. There was an obvious temptation
for the inquisitor to discover heresy in all manner of
disguises.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> Heresy was conceived as a most insidious
as well as a most pernicious enemy, to be ferreted out
in all sorts of strange lurking-places. The indefiniteness
of the term—the inquisitor’s definition is always a
catalogue—was as a matter of fact unavoidable, seeing
that the offence consisted, not in an overt act, but in an
intention. It was a crime of the intellect, a matter of
the state of a man’s mind and disposition. Sometimes
the heresy might be revealed in an act, but very often
there would be no formal act at all. The inquisitor must
be a searcher of the heart and a prober into the obscure
workings of the mind.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> It is necessary to add one
simpler but important point. No one could be a heretic
unless he had been baptized, unless he was a member of
the Christian Church.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> The infidel, the Turk, the Jew,
did not come within the Inquisition’s purview—unless
he had at one time received the Christian religion. By
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>birth or adoption the heretic must have been a Christian:
for the heinousness of his crime consists in its being a
repudiation, a rebellion.</p>

<p>The Inquisition formulated a number of classifications
of heretics. In the first place, they used
to distinguish between <i>affirmative</i> and <i>negative</i> heretics.
The former was one who deliberately avowed some
opinion contrary to the faith before the tribunal; the
latter was one who either denied being guilty of the
incriminating word or act or else, while acknowledging
it, protested that he had no culpable intention.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> In the
second place, a distinction was drawn between the
<i>perfected</i> heretic and the <i>imperfect</i>. The first not only
held an error, but also practised the rites appertaining
to it, modelled his life on its dogma; the latter merely
believed the error without being guilty of the evil
practices.</p>

<p>The inquisitors also recognized a class consisting of
people who were not really heretics at all, perfect or
imperfect, but merely people who gave evidence of
heretical disposition or of tendencies which might lead
them into heresy. In the fact of its taking cognisance
of such a class lies one of the distinguishing features of
the Inquisition.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> The tribunal deliberately dealt with,
and had a specific treatment for, those who were merely
<i>suspected</i> of crime. Suspicion was classified as light,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>vehement or violent. There was no precise definition
of what was meant by each of these; it was generally
left to the inquisitor to decide in each particular case
what degree of suspicion existed. It was most essential
to avoid all contact with heretics.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> A man proved to
have saluted a heretic or listened to his preaching on a
single occasion was regarded as <i>lightly</i> suspect; if he
had done so more than once, he was <i>vehemently</i> suspect;
if he had done so frequently, he was <i>violently</i> suspect.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a>
But such an offence as this, even if often repeated, was not
regarded as in itself sufficient evidence of actual heresy.
It only made the offender a marked man. In such cases
the Inquisition did not dismiss the accused as not guilty;
it would not absolutely dismiss a case, unless satisfied
that there was no proof whatever. This was due to the
intangible nature of an offence which consisted in an
intention.</p>

<p>The consequence was that the Inquisition, in order
to be on the safe side, virtually created a minor offence
of allowing oneself to be suspected of heresy. For every
good Catholic must realize that any connection with heresy,
however remote, is contamination and therefore take the
most elaborate precautions to avoid all contact. To become
an object of suspicion, therefore, meant either that the
suspicion was after all well-founded (on the principle that
there is no smoke without fire), or that the conduct which
led to suspicion was inadvertent. Was it, then, unreasonable
to require that the suspect should make a formal
abjuration, to prove that in fact he had no sympathy
whatever with heresy, that the suspicion was unfounded?
Nor, surely, was it unjust to record such cases of suspicion
in view of the possibility that the suspect might at some
later date come up once more before the tribunal, when
naturally his former offence would be legitimate evidence
against him? Such is the line of argument in justification
of the penalizing of the suspected, as well as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>convicted. The suspect is indeed guilty, not of the
major offence of actual heresy, but of a minor offence
of misdemeanour, improper or at least imprudent behaviour,
unbecoming to a good Catholic—an offence
legitimately dealt with by the tribunal concerned with
heresy.</p>

<p>Another class of offenders were fautors or defenders
of heretics. To place any obstruction in the way of the
inquisitors was an act of fautorship. A lord who neglected
to pursue heretics out of his lands; anyone giving
ecclesiastical burial to a heretic; one who in conversation
excused a heretic or conferred any sort of favour,
however slight, upon one—all these were fautors. For
a doctor to attend a heretic patient, a lawyer to plead
a heretic client’s case, was exceedingly dangerous, unless
they could prove beyond all doubt that they did so in
ignorance. The simplest deed of common humanity
done to a heretic was in the view of the Church a sin.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a>
Certain crimes were triable by the Inquisition, not for
themselves, but because they were indicative of false
doctrine. Thus a usurer might be tried and punished
by the Inquisition, not because he was a sinner, but
because he showed that he did not regard himself as
such. Similarly, a bigamist might be tried by the Inquisition,
not because bigamy was an immoral thing—if
he could prove that he acted under the stress of simple
unreflecting passion the Inquisition would dismiss the
case as not coming under its purview—but because his
act evinced erroneous belief regarding the sacrament
of marriage.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></p>

<p>It was the same with a number of other moral offences.
Adultery did not in itself come under the cognizance of
the tribunal; but if the adulterer maintained that his
transgression was not a sin, it did. There is, for instance,
the case of a licentious priest living in concubinage being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>punished by the Inquisition, because he asserted that he
was purified of his ill-living by the simple act of putting
on his vestments. In a word, an error in morals is triable
only if it is also an error in belief. Otherwise, it is dealt
with by the ordinary ecclesiastical courts. As it is
arguable that a large number of crimes are indicative of
doctrinal error, the Holy Office could put forward a
rather sweeping claim to judicature over all manner of
wrong-doing; but in practice there was probably not
much trouble as a rule, the tribunal being kept sufficiently
well occupied with offences <i>in intellectu</i>. Only when
the implication of heresy was the significant feature of
a crime was the Inquisition likely to be interested.</p>

<p>The list of offences coming within the sphere of
inquisitorial judicature is completed with the mention
of sorcery and witchcraft, practices essentially implying
heresy.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>The ingenious Ludovico à Paramo, ever anxious to
discover warranty for all that the Inquisition was and
did in the Bible, and particularly in the infancy of the
human race, discovered the beginnings of the inquisitorial
process in the Book of Genesis. Thus God was the first
inquisitor; the call, ‘Adam, where art thou?’ was a
citation to a heretic; the coats of skins made for Adam
and Eve were special garb for heretics, the original of
the special garb, the <i>sanbenitos</i>, with which the Holy
Office clad its culprits; and the deprivation of Adam
and Eve of paradise was equivalent to the confiscation
of the heretic’s goods.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a></p>

<p>We shall find a more practically helpful explanation
of the procedure of the Inquisition if we content ourselves
by remembering the origins of the tribunal in the
Middle Ages. The fundamental fact, which shaped the
whole character of its judicature, giving it its essential
distinctiveness apart from other judicatures, was the
function of the inquisitor. Originally he had been, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>a judge, but a missionary; he never became a judge
simply and solely, he never entirely ceased to be a
missionary. His primary object was not so much to
pronounce a judgment as to guard the faith; his ambition
not to condemn a heretic, but to reconcile him to
the Church. Every impenitent heretic was in a sense
a witness to inquisitorial failure, every penitent was a
triumph. The inquisitor, even when sitting in his
tribunal, was not solely a judicial functionary; he was
still a confessor, a spiritual guide. This fact is the keynote
to the procedure of the Inquisition, because it
meant that the procedure was not simply and wholly
judicial. The Inquisition aimed at being something
more than a court. Its ultimate object was not secured
by the simple judicial process of deciding the guilt or
innocence of the accused; it sought the spiritual end of
bringing the accused to a right state of mind and soul.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a></p>

<p>Consequently, the inquisitor is always actuated by
the desire to secure confession. That does not by any
means necessarily involve conviction. What is wanted
is that everyone arraigned before the tribunal should
publicly in the proceedings acknowledge his acceptance
of the Catholic faith. If he is not guilty, not a heretic
at all, the inquisitor has reason for personal rejoicing—there
is one scandal less to the Church and the faith.
Or if the accused is guilty, but acknowledges his guilt
and is of his own accord, without compulsion, willing
to recant, again so much the better. It was preferable
that the lost sheep should voluntarily return, or allow
itself quietly to be led back, into the fold than that it
should have to be forcibly driven in. What the Church
least desired was that the sheep should be lost altogether.
Only if all means to secure reconciliation had failed, was
it possible to acquiesce in such defeat. But the Church,
in giving the most earnest solicitude to the errant individual,
had to think also, and yet more earnestly, of
the whole community, and of the sanctity and majesty
of the truth which the obdurate heretic had spurned.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>
<p>Consequently, a salutary example must be made, the
penalty being duly solemn and impressive. But the mild
methods first.</p>

<p>The second distinctive feature of the Inquisition was
the methods of originating proceedings before it. Whereas,
under Roman law, either the accusation by an individual
or the denunciation by an official was necessary
before proceedings could be initiated, an <i>inquisitio</i> could
be instituted as the result of a <i>diffamatio</i>, the general
report of the inhabitants of any community, a parish,
a <i>seigneurie</i>, a town. It was indeed laid down that the
<i>diffamatio</i> must be <i>apud bonos et graves</i>, people of standing
and gravity of character. This stipulation was no
doubt something of a safeguard: nevertheless it remains
true that, as no individual had to take upon himself the
onus of showing that he had good cause for preferring
a charge, the simple fact of unpopularity with his neighbours
might be quite sufficient for the institution of
proceedings against a man who was for any reason, just
or unjust, taboo among them. This method of justice
belonged to Canon law; there was no trace of it in
Roman law; but it has to be remembered that it was not
instituted specifically against heretics, but rather against
clerical wrong-doers in high places, who passed unchecked
because the necessary number of accusers willing to
take upon themselves the responsibility, and also possibly
danger, of prosecution could not readily be found.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a></p>

<p>Simple rumour by itself was not of great practical
value. It had to be organized. Hence the ruling of
Innocent Ill’s decretal, <i>Licet Heli</i> (1199), relating to
clerical abuses, that superiors are to keep diligent watch
over their subordinates, so as to bring their misdoings
before judicial authority; hence, as regards heresy, the
system of ‘synodal witnesses,’ whose specific duty it
was to vocalize local public opinion or knowledge. The
general vague <i>diffamatio</i> of the neighbourhood is by
them so crystallized as to become of practical value in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>a court of law. But while this system of using the
depositions of the synodal witnesses and the village clergy,
accomplished much, further organization was needed.
The additional device necessary was provided by the
institution of the special papal delegates, who were
inquisitors in two different senses—judicial officers,
examining charges brought before them as members of a
tribunal; but also procurators making the preliminary
investigations prior to trial. They had two distinct
functions, two distinct inquisitions to make. These are
technically <i>inquisitio generalis</i> and <i>inquisitio specialis</i>.</p>

<p>As the system became elaborated, the inquisitors
had at their command a formidable spy system, carried
on by their agents, the familiars. At the same time
much encouragement was given to wholesale delation.
The inquisitor or his vicar would make a sudden dramatic
descent upon town or village, and deliver a solemn,
perhaps menacing, exhortation to the inhabitants to
proffer information against heretics. By thus appealing
to the religious zeal or the apprehensions of the populace
many accusations would be obtained, often from husbands
and wives, parents and children. But to reinforce such
voluntary incriminations it was customary to proclaim
a ‘time of grace,’ which lasted from a fortnight to a
month. If within that period the heretic came forward,
acknowledged his own guilt and gave any information
he possessed against others, he would obtain either
complete exemption or considerable alleviation from
the penalties merited by heresy. This method, Bernard
Gui assures us, was remarkably satisfactory.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a></p>

<p>The <i>inquisitio generalis</i> being concluded, and prisoners
obtained either by voluntary self-denunciations or on
the information of others, the judge, according to
canonical usage, had a choice of expedients. He could
either proceed to an <i>inquisitio specialis</i> or make use of
the method of <i>purgatio canonica</i>. The second method
had been solemnly adopted by the Church in 803.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>was an appeal to God. The accused solemnly swore
by the Gospels that he was innocent, while those of his
friends or neighbours willing to support him acted as
his <i>compurgatores</i> and gave similar solemn testimony
to his innocence, their number, from two or three to forty,
varying in accordance with the degree of suspicion existing
against him. The device was obviously defective. Its
only advantage lay in the impressiveness of its appeal
to the devout mind, persuaded of the heinousness of the
sin of perjury, while it allowed the innocent man to
suffer, if he happened to be unpopular and could not
prevail upon the necessary number of compurgators
to assist him, and also allowed the guilty to go free, so
long as he was not over-scrupulous as regards perjury
and had the necessary popularity to persuade, or power
to compel, others to act as his compurgators. Thus,
while the system of canonical purgation was never
abolished, it had fallen into virtual desuetude before the
end of the thirteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> In practice the <i>inquisitio
generalis</i> was followed automatically by the <i>inquisitio
specialis</i>. The accused was served with a citation to
appear before the tribunal and kept in prison pending
his trial.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a></p>

<p>In the case of those who had yielded themselves up
of their own accord, the voluntary act constituted the
confession, which it was the inquisitor’s object to obtain.
For those accused who refused to confess there followed
the interrogatory. Here the inquisitor acted as prosecutor
and cross-examiner, as a sort of <i>juge d’instruction</i>.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a>
Only the inquisitor’s office, unlike that of the <i>juge
d’instruction</i>, did not end with the completion of the
interrogatory; having conducted the examination, he
would also afterwards pronounce the sentence. The
interrogatory resolved itself into an unequal contest
between inquisitor and accused. It was unequal, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>the first place, because there was always a presumption
against anyone charged with heresy. As we have seen,
it was an offence for anyone to be so criminally negligent in
vitally important matters as to allow his conduct to
give rise to the slightest rumour of heresy. It was an
excellent characteristic of both Roman and Canon law
that the accused was held to be innocent until actually
proved to be guilty. This characteristic was not shewn, in
actual practice, in dealing with one accused of heresy. The
mere fact of defamation tainted a man. It was, therefore,
a matter of very great difficulty for the defendant
to demonstrate his innocence. He had to demonstrate
it; for the mere fact of the <i>diffamatio</i>, whether well-grounded
or not, was good evidence against him; and
to free himself, he must rebut this evidence. The
process was indeed so difficult that it was much safer
to confess guilt at the outset than to labour to prove
innocence.</p>

<p>In the second place, the duel was unequal because
the inquisitor considered it perfectly legitimate to disconcert
his adversary by means of disingenuous subtleties
and subterfuges. It is only fair to add that the inquisitor
adopted such devices because he believed that the
heretic was apt to indulge in them and might save himself
by clever equivocations unless dealt with astutely; and
the inquisitor had a lively sense of the extreme undesirability
of permitting a heretic to get the better of him in a
duel of wits. Such a thing would be ignominious for
the inquisitor; a blow to the Church and the truth. We
are told of some of the artifices practised by Waldenses.
In answer to the question: ‘What is Holy Church?’
they will say, ‘What you consider to be such’ or assert
that they are simple illiterate men standing in need of
instruction, and must leave it to the judge to express
their beliefs in words. That the inquisitors may have
found the rejoinders even of illiterate men at times
disconcerting is likely.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> But it is certain that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>practised their subtleties on many who had not the wits
to cope with them: and, in any case, the inquisitor,
being both examiner and judge, had an enormous initial
advantage. As a rule, the inquisitor or his vicar was
extremely well equipped to conduct the interrogatory
skilfully and successfully, even against the most redoubtable
antagonists. They possessed, moreover, a
rich repository of ready-made devices in the treatises
written by the great masters of the inquisitorial art.
The difficulty of escaping from the tentacles of the
inquisitorial process inspired Bernard Délicieux to say
that even the orthodoxy of St. Peter and St. Paul
would not have been sufficient to satisfy the tribunal.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a>
It was held to be legitimate to surprise and confuse
the defendant by a multiplicity of questions, which
would involve him in contradictions.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a></p>

<p>Altogether the dice were heavily loaded against the
accused. Dismayed to begin with very likely by the
simple shock of finding himself accused of the terrible
crime of heresy,<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> confronted by a formidable examiner,
who was clearly bent upon securing a confession if at all
possible, he had also to face the great obstacle presented by
the close secrecy of all the proceedings. There was none
of the security that comes from the open trial, none of
the encouragement to make a good fight for freedom,
for honour, for life that comes from publicity. Again,
the chances of acquittal were very small when the agreement
of only two of the witnesses against him was sufficient
for the condemnation of the accused, whether he confessed
or not: especially as the delicate question of what constituted
sufficient agreement was left to the discretion
of the judge. It was laid down that agreement in substance
was sufficient; and even when there was discord in
the evidence of the two witnesses, this was not sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>to secure acquittal. Moreover, evidence, not good
enough to procure conviction, would be good enough to
serve as the basis of a prolonged, searching and perplexing
examination, in which the accused was more likely to
incriminate than to clear himself.<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a></p>

<p>A further heavy obstacle to the making of a defence
was insufficiency of information. While the résumé or
<i>capitula</i> of the charges preferred against him was communicated
to the defendant, on the other hand, the
names of the witnesses were withheld from him, and he
was not allowed to read their evidence <i>in extenso</i>. This
practice of secrecy commenced early in the thirteenth
century in Languedoc, and the rule soon came to apply
in most other countries. Occasionally the names were
given, though in an incomplete or confusing fashion<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a>;
but the inquisitors themselves were in favour of not
disclosing names at all.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> This was owing to the circumstances
in which the Inquisition had originated,
amid an unfriendly populace.<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> There had been cases
of the assassination of witnesses by the friends of the
accused; and undoubtedly there was always a certain
element of risk in giving evidence against a heretic in a
country where heresy flourished and was popular. In
those early days the inquisitor was very likely endangering
his life in the prosecution of his labours: in such
circumstances, if the indispensable evidence was to be
collected, some sort of safeguard for voluntary witnesses
was reasonable.</p>

<p>But an arrangement, which was justified, and perhaps
rendered imperative, by the conditions prevailing when the
Inquisition began, was continued indefinitely, and maintained
when not the witnesses but the defendant belonged
to an unpopular minority and stood in urgent need of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>some protection. How could anyone put on trial make an
effective answer to the charges brought against him when
he was never allowed to confront the witnesses, did not
even know their identity, and was permitted to see only
a <i>précis</i> of their testimony? It is obvious that the system,
whatever its origin, became in course of time a positive
encouragement to delation and a temptation to perjury.
But it is only right to add that the Inquisition, both in
the Middle Ages and later on, showed itself at times
extremely severe in punishing proved cases of false
witness.<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, as a rule, the Inquisition was not at all
nice in its selection of evidence, and certainly not impartial.
It accepted the evidence of persons who were
debarred from bearing testimony in the secular courts.
It even accepted the evidence of one heretic against
another, though it never admitted that the evidence of
one heretic in favour of another had the slightest validity.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a>
Similarly the Inquisition permitted, indeed encouraged,
husbands to testify against their wives, children against
parents, servants against masters; though their favourable
testimony was rejected.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> The rules as regards age
seem to have varied in different countries; but certainly
it is, generally speaking, true that persons were permitted
to give evidence before the Holy Office at an age when
their testimony would not have been received in a lay
court. We even hear of a case at Montségur of a child of
six incriminating members of his own family and many
others. The ordinary rules regarding the status and
character of witnesses were similarly in abeyance.
Criminals and men of infamous reputation, homicides,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>harlots, proved perjurers and excommunicates were none
of them debarred from giving evidence against heretics.</p>

<p>Information might be forthcoming from the confessional.
What were the duties of a father-confessor in
such a case? There was, on the one hand, the fact of the
extraordinary heinousness of this offence which had
necessitated the creation of a special court for its suppression;
but, on the other hand, the institution of the
confessional had to be safeguarded and a feeling of security
be assured to the penitent, without which he could not
be expected to make a full and free confession of all his
sins, whatever their magnitude. The solution was that
the granting of absolution, upon an avowal of heresy, lay
outside the powers of an ordinary confessor; he must
refer the matter to his superiors. The question coming
up before the Council of Tarragona in 1242, it was indeed
decided that, although a confessor granting absolution
for heresy without consulting his bishop merited censure,
nevertheless his grant of absolution, if duly certified
by himself, should entitle the penitent to a limited
protection, <i>i.e.</i> immunity from temporal penalties.
This, however, was an isolated ruling, and it was generally
recognized that heresy was a ‘reserved’ case.</p>

<p>Absolution by an ordinary confessor was invalid and
could be no safeguard from the institution of inquisitorial
proceedings against a penitent, should evidence of heresy
be preferred against him. But what if, in spite of his
knowledge that he could not obtain absolution from his
confessor, a penitent incriminated himself; what if he,
inadvertently perhaps, incriminated others? Was information
derived by a confessor in such a way sacrosanct,
because obtained in the confessional? Not apparently
in Toulouse and Carcassonne at all events. There
priests were positively enjoined to utilize the hearing of
confessions to make diligent enquiry concerning heretics,
their believers and fautors, and also to confide carefully
to writing anything they learnt. They were also to take
the penitent before the bishop or his vicar, so that he
might there repeat his testimony. But if the penitent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
was unwilling to do this, the priest was ‘notwithstanding
this’ to seek advice from expert and God-fearing persons,
as to how he should proceed further. What this must
involve is not specified; but clearly the only conceivable
further proceedings are either to bring more pressure to
bear upon the penitent, or else to use his evidence without
his consent. Even if the latter never happened, the
former course is not in strict accordance with the rules
that should regulate the confessional.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a></p>

<p>Yet another most serious disability, under which the
accused laboured, was that he was not allowed the assistance
of an advocate, he was thrown entirely on his own
resources in making his defence. Innocent III expressly
forbade advocates and notaries to lend any aid to heretics
or their abettors. The prohibition at first applied only
to the case of open and avowed heretics. Eymeric ruled
that counsel were in no wise to be denied to the accused,
but he followed this up by the qualification, that advocates
espousing the cause of a heretic rendered themselves
liable to prosecution before the Inquisition, as
suspect of heresy themselves for doing so.<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> In actual
practice what happened probably was that when
the evidence against the accused was clear, he need
expect no advocate; but when it was weak, then an
advocate might be forthcoming. For if the evidence in
support of the charge of heresy was strong, then assist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>ance
given to the accused was tantamount to fautorship
of heresy, which was in itself a very serious offence. In
any case the rôle of advocate was dangerous and there
was no inducement to compensate for so grave a risk.</p>

<p>That such assistance was seldom, if ever, actually
given seems proved by the absence of any indication of
the practice even in the early inquisitorial registers.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a>
Very soon, however, it was decided absolutely that the
use of advocates was to be prohibited. Such was the
ruling of the Council of Albi in 1254; and the regulation
soon became general.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> This was the really inevitable
consequence of the view which made the suspect a
marked, a tainted man even before he had stood his
trial. But certainly one consideration which weighed
heavily against the use of advocates was the possibility
of the practice encouraging the spread of heresy, though
the chances of an advocate’s allowing himself to be
infected by his client’s erroneous doctrines were remote.
In its attitude towards this question we are once more
reminded of the fundamental fact of the Inquisition’s
twofold nature. If the inquisitor be considered as a
confessor, the accused as a penitent paternally exhorted,
lovingly urged to reconciliation, pardon being assured
for the truly repentant, what possible need can there
be for an advocate?<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> The tribunal gave every facility
for the escape of the prisoner from all the possible unhappy
consequences of his defamation, down <i>one</i> avenue—confession,
penance, reinstatement.</p>

<p>If the defendant was obstinately determined on
defending himself, instead of throwing himself upon the
mercy of the inquisitor, as representative of the infinite
compassion of the Church, he was very much limited in
his choice of pleadings. Ignorance was a possible plea—more
likely to be accepted in the case of a woman than
a man—but inquisitors were on their guard against
feigned ignorance. That words complained of were only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>a <i>lapsus linguae</i>, or an idle jest uttered on the spur of
the moment, or in drunkenness, might be accepted as
a legitimate excuse. The plea of great perturbation of
mind—mortal terror, for instance—might also possibly
be accepted; but not the madness of love or the sudden
grief of bereavement.<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> To make out a case on these lines
was in any event very difficult, and the only device that
promised any really good prospect of success was to
challenge a witness on the ground that he was actuated
by personal malice. But as the witnesses’ names were
not disclosed, this was no easy matter. All that the
accused could do, was to mention the names of any of
his neighbours who might bear him a grudge, on the
chance that they might be included among the authors
of his defamation.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> But it was not sufficient to indicate
simple ill-will. The charge of heresy was so terrible that
it was assumed that little short of mortal enmity would
induce anyone to prefer it maliciously. The accused
would, therefore, be carefully examined as to the nature
of any quarrel with his neighbours that he might allege
in his defence. The only purpose for which he was
allowed the use of witnesses was to prove the facts of
such a quarrel.</p>

<p>It must be clear that even when the presiding judge
was a fair-minded, conscientious man, not too fanatical,
the chances of effective defence were small. And the
prosecution was exceedingly strong. If preliminary
inducements, the subtleties of the interrogatory, the
absence of means of defence, all proved insufficient to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>produce the desired confession, it was possible severely
to shake the <i>moral</i> of the defendant by subjecting his
case to prolonged delay, which was calculated to impose
a great strain upon the nerves. Except in rare instances
time was no consideration to the Inquisition. Its invincible
patience was one of the most terrible of its weapons.
It was willing relentlessly to wait, not merely weeks and
months, but years and many years. It was quite common
for an interval of anything up to ten years to elapse
between the date of the first interrogatory and that of
the final condemnation. The period might be considerably
longer. We hear of a man, first brought to
trial in 1301, being sentenced to death in 1319.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> This
slow torture of suspense was generally endured in prison,
where the recalcitrant would probably receive frequent
visits from the inquisitor or his assistants, who would
instruct him and exhort him to make confession. If
simple incarceration proved insufficient to overcome the
victim’s fortitude, great additional hardships could be
introduced—insufficiency of food, comfort, rest.</p>

<p>Finally, the most celebrated weapon which the
Inquisition possessed for procuring confession was torture
itself. Torture had been known to both Roman and
barbarian law, being used even for such minor offences
as theft.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> On the other hand, according to all the best
authorities, it was strange to Canon law. It did indeed
recognize flogging, but only as a punishment or penance.
Gratian laid it down categorically that torture was not
to be used as a means of extorting confession. It was
not until after the condemnation of the ordeal by the
Lateran Council of 1215 that the Church sanctioned its
use for this purpose. In the bull, <i>Ad extirpanda</i>, published
in 1252 by Innocent IV, the employment of torture
was not merely permitted, but enjoined.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> The rule was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>thereby laid down, that any sort of torment short of
mutilation was to be utilized in order to obtain confessions
and information. But the actual infliction of the torture
was to be carried out by the secular arm. The idea of
the clergy’s personally superintending the infliction of
cruelty was very properly repugnant.</p>

<p>The sense of repugnance did not last long, however.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a>
The inquisitors of the thirteenth century found
Innocent IV’s proviso irksome. The employment of
a secular official to assist them in carrying through the
inquisitorial process was no doubt inconvenient, and in
1256 Alexander IV overcame the difficulty by granting
inquisitors and their assistants the privilege of absolving
one another, or giving one another dispensations, for any
canonical irregularities they might commit in the pursuance
of their duties.<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> This was an oblique reference to
torture. This rule was reinforced by Urban IV in 1262.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a>
The subterfuge satisfied the scruples of the inquisitors.</p>

<p>The extent to which torture was used no doubt
varied in accordance with the character of the inquisitor.
In the sentences of Bernard de Caux there is only one
passing mention of the practice; there is only one mention
of it also in Bernard Gui. Though it is frequently
referred to by Geoffrey d’Ablis, this is in a negative
way only.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> It is stated that so and so confessed freely,
no torture having to be used. But that torture was being
used and with great severity is proved by the intervention
of Philip the Fair in 1291 and 1301, and of Clement V in
1306; while in 1311 the Pope endeavoured to moderate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>the practice by the requirement that torture should not
be inflicted save with the concurrence of the bishop of the
diocese.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> Bernard Gui very much resented the restriction,
and though in his sentences there is only the one mention
of torture, it is clear from his treatise that he thoroughly
approved of it, on account of its great utility.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a></p>

<p>Certainly torture was regarded by inquisitors of the
best type, not as a habitual practice, but only as a final
measure, to be used solely when other means had failed.
Eymeric lays it down that the circumstances justifying
its application are that the case against the accused
has been half-proved already or that the accused has
contradicted himself.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a></p>

<p>It was a very salutary rule that no prisoner might be
tortured more than once; but this humane regulation
became a dead-letter. The inquisitors found it galling
and surmounted the obstacle with an utterly disgraceful
quibble. Torture, they agreed, could not be <i>repeated</i>;
but it might be <i>continued</i>.<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> They used this patent
sophistry to justify the application of torture an indefinite
number of times at indefinite intervals. Thus some
of the witches of Arras were tortured forty times, twice
in a day.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> In such cavalier fashion could rules and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>regulations be treated. The requirement that confessions
must be freely made without restraint was satisfied by
another similar subterfuge. A confession, which had
actually been wrung from the defendant or witness in
the physical anguish of torture, was confirmed some two
or three days later in some other place than the torture
chamber; and this confirmation of the actual confession
was officially regarded as the true confession.<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a></p>

<p>There were no exemptions from the administration
of torture on the ground of youth, old age or infirmity,
except for pregnant women. Old men and women, young
children might all be subjected to the process, only in
their case the infliction must be light.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a></p>

<p>Eymeric laid it down that at all times the application
must be moderate and that there must never be any
effusion of blood. The term ‘moderate’ is vague;
and it is clear that there was no strict general rule, the
determining factor here, as so often with the Inquisition,
being the discretion of the judge.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> The unhappy victim,
on being brought into the chamber, was first of all shown
the instruments of torment and urged to confess without
recourse being had to them. In some cases this alone
was sufficient. But if a confession was not immediately
forthcoming, the prisoner—male or female, it made no
difference—was stripped naked and bound by the executioners.
A second exhortation to confess followed.
If still there was no confession, the victim was then
actually subjected to the pain of the rack, the pulleys, the
strappado and the other devices of calculated cruelty,
which were regarded as appropriate for the coercion of
recalcitrant suspect or unwilling witness. Continued
refusal to speak led to increase in the severity of the
application; further obduracy with increase in the
severity of the type of torture. The refinements of
cruelty in the machines and devices at the inquisitor’s
disposal were so exquisite that it is marvellous with what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>constancy they were often endured. There were many,
no doubt, who submitted at the simple threat of torture
or at the first turn of the screw; others who with almost
superhuman endurance bore frightful extremities of pain.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The important subject of the influence exerted by the
procedure of the Inquisition upon the civil courts of Europe has
never been thoroughly worked out. There is partial treatment of
it in Esmein’s <i>Histoire de la Procédure Criminelle en France</i>; English
version, <i>A History of Continental Criminal Procedure</i>; H. Brunner,
<i>Die Entstehung der Schwurgerichte</i> (1872); C. V. Langlois, <i>L’Inquisition

H. C. Lea, <i>Superstition and Force</i>, esp. pp. 428-590. Vol. v of the
Continental Legal History Series, published by the Association of
American Law Schools, while mainly based on Esmein’s study of
Criminal Procedure in France, is of wider scope and traces the inquisitorial
system in Europe generally. While the system of <i>inquisitio</i>,
derived from the later Roman Empire, was not passed on to the civil
courts of Europe solely through the <i>inquisitio haereticae pravitatis</i>,
it is the case that ‘The Church was able to furnish the secular courts
with a lesson and a model.... By its example it paved the way
for the substitution, consummated in the 1500’s, of the inquisitorial
procedure for the accusatory procedure in every country of Europe.’
Again: ‘This system, originally employed for prosecutions for heresy,
afterwards for all crimes, became, under the name of “procédure
à l’extraordinaire,” the system of common law in force in the royal
jurisdictions for the prosecution of serious crimes until 1789.’—<i>A

<h3>CHAPTER V - INQUISITORIAL PENALTIES</h3>

<p>Acquittals being virtually unknown,<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> nearly every case
brought before the Holy Office involved the sentence of
one penalty or another. The word ‘penalty’ is not
technically exact. Strictly speaking, the Inquisition was
concerned not with crimes and punishments, but with
spiritual errors and penances.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> Thus, when the tribunal
consigned some one to prison, its formula ran that the
man in question shall betake himself to prison and there
penance himself on a diet of bread and water. No confessor
will regard the mere expression of contrition as
sufficient in itself; nor will the genuine penitent be
satisfied. Penance is the outward and visible sign of
sincere repentance, and an earnest of future amendment
of life. All the penalties inflicted by the Inquisition had
this expiatory character.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> Some of them were of quite a
trivial description. The penitent ‘suspect’ might simply
be enjoined to hear Mass on so many Sundays and festivals,
or—if his commercial practice suggested unsoundness of
doctrine on the subject of interest—to undertake not to
exact usury in the future or to promise to restore ill-gotten
gains.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> But, as a rule, the penance was a much more
serious matter. One of the most frequent was that of
pilgrimages.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> These were of various kinds. In the
earlier days of the Inquisition the penitent<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> was often
sent to Palestine on crusade against the infidel. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>after the failure of St. Louis’ expedition and the fall of
the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the crusade ceased to find a
place among inquisitorial penances. Ordinary pilgrimages
were classified as <i>greater</i> or <i>less</i>. The former took
the penitent out of his own country and involved long
travelling; the latter were to shrines in his own country.
Thus for a Frenchman Rome, the shrine of St. Thomas
at Canterbury, Cologne, St. James of Compostella,
Constantinople would come under the first category;
Paris, Boulogne, Bordeaux, Vienne under the latter. The
undertaking of the longer journeys might be a most
severe imposition. The penitent had to abandon his
work and set out upon travels which might well occupy
many months and even years. He probably had to endure
much real suffering, fatigue, and privation. In the case
of the crusade, and probably in other pilgrimages as well,
there was an element of personal danger. In the pilgrim’s
absence what happened to his family and dependents?
In many instances one supposes that on his return after
a long absence he must have found his occupation gone.
Those condemned to make pilgrimages received from the
inquisitor letters which explained their itinerary and
might give instructions as to certain additional penances
they had to undergo, while they at the same time
served as safe-conducts, of which there might be much
need in localities where popular feeling was strong against
heretics. Pilgrims were required to bring back with them
written attestations, signed by the chaplains at shrines
they were ordered to visit, in proof that they had actually
carried out the prescribed programme.<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a></p>

<p>The penance of pilgrimage was often united with two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>others—scourging and the wearing of crosses, or other
marks on the clothing, indicative of the penitent heretic.
Flagellation by itself was regarded as one of the lightest
of penances. The Councils of Tarragona (1242) and of
Narbonne (1243) fixed it as the penance to be undergone
by those who voluntarily made confession during the
term of grace—that is, by the least culpable of all possible
kinds of heretic. The custom was for the flogging to be
inflicted in public and in ceremonious fashion. The
penitent was obliged to present himself on the appointed
days stripped to the waist, and to bring the rod with him.
As a general rule the day appointed was Sunday, and
the priest performed the operation of scourging upon the
penitent between the reading of the Epistle and of the
Gospel during Mass. Whether the operation was painful
or not is disputed. One commentator supposes that it
was no light matter and that the penitent was soundly
whipped; another argues that, as the whipping was done
at the altar by inexperienced hands and the sufferer was
in a position to cry out and resist during divine service,
the humiliation was the most severe part of the penance.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a>
One may perhaps conclude that the severity of the
flagellation depended very much upon the intention of
the inquisitors and the strength of arm of the ministering
priest. Sometimes the sufferer might have to submit
to the scourging in processions through the streets or in
every house in which he had been seen in company with
heretics; or, in the case of the pilgrim, at the various
shrines visited. Such repeated floggings may or may
not have been very painful, but even in days when
they would not produce such a sense of shame as now,
they must have been very humiliating.</p>

<p>In this respect the wearing of crosses was even worse.
The origin of this penance was that during his missionary
labours St. Dominic had ordered penitents to wear two
small crosses, sewn on the breast of their clothing in token
of contrition. The Inquisition adopted the practice and
it was very frequently inflicted, being prescribed, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>flagellation, for those who voluntarily made confession
of heresy. Next to imprisonment this penance figures
most often in the sentences of Bernard Gui; it was rather
less extensively used latterly. The small marks which
St. Dominic had required became under the Inquisition
very large ones—as a rule two-and-a-half palms in height,
two in breadth. They were saffron in colour and had to
be worn one on the breast, the other on the back. Other
symbols besides crosses were sometimes used. Thus
false witnesses had to wear the symbol of red tongues,
prisoners liberated on bail hammers, sorcerers the
representation of demons. The wearing of distinguishing
marks was designed to be, and was felt to be, a less tolerable
penalty than flogging. The shameful garb had to be
worn continuously indoors and out, exposing the wearer
at all times to the jeers, if not the fanatical hostility, of
the crowd. The penance was enjoined sometimes for
an indefinite period, and so long as he had to wear it, it
would be difficult for the penitent to obtain employment.
It is plain that evasion was frequently attempted. The
Council of Béziers (1233) prescribed confiscation of goods
for those who either refused to wear the crosses or tried
to conceal them.<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> The Council of Valence (1248) went
further and decreed that evasion should be regarded as
a sign of impenitent heresy. But evidently the hardships
attendant upon this penance were so great that
the Church felt it must do something to mitigate their
severity, and the Council of Béziers (1246) commanded
that penitents wearing crosses should not be subjected
to ridicule or excluded from the transaction of business.<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>There were penalties of a pecuniary nature—the
exaction of fines, the confiscation of property. In earlier
days, when it was yet thought of as contrary to the
principles of their origin that the Friars should receive
money on any pretext, it was felt to be repugnant that
inquisitors, being friars, should exact fines. On the
other hand, from of old it had been regarded as a normal
and praiseworthy form of showing genuine contrition to
give alms; and it would have been surprising had this
sort of penance been found absent from Inquisitorial
practice. From the time of the Council of Béziers (1246)
onwards, it seems to have been recognized that the
exaction of a fine was a perfectly legitimate form of
penance, the proceeds to be used for the maintenance of
inquisitorial prisons and similar necessary expenses.
Eymeric laid it down that this penance should be used
‘decently and in such a way as not to give offence to
the laity.’<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> A broader interpretation came to be made
of the ‘pious’ purposes for which the proceeds of fines
might properly be utilized; they might even include
public work of general utility, such as the building of
bridges.<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> In moderation, the payment of a fine was a
form of penance much more easily borne than those
already mentioned; and if the money was used for such
objects as the erection of a church or chapel or hospital,
the maintenance of the poor or other such philanthropic
work, it seems an eminently justifiable sort of penalty.</p>

<p>It had, however, one serious drawback—namely, that
the profits might be used for ends much less worthy, for the
personal enrichment of the judges, and might be a temptation
to extortion. Innocent IV, who in 1245 had directed
that fines must be utilized solely for the building and
upkeep of prisons, is found in 1249 strongly inveighing
against inquisitors for the enormity of their exactions,
and in 1251 prohibiting the imposition of fines where any
other form of penance would serve. Despite this injunction,
the penance was still employed; but the papal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>pronouncement is evidence, not only of the obvious
temptation to extortion, but also of the fact of inquisitors’
yielding to it.</p>

<p>A fine was the customary penalty for such a minor
offence as the thoughtless utterance of blasphemous
words; it was also frequently exacted in commutation
of other forms of penance, as for example that of pilgrimage,
when the penitent was too old or infirm to perform it,
or again in the case of a young girl not fit to undergo the
ardours of a journey across Europe.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> So also when the
death of a heretic left his prescribed penance uncompleted,
the rule was that his heirs had to make compensation in
the form of money, which might be heavy in amount.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a>
The provocation to extortion in both these instances is
obvious. The accounts of the Inquisition were unchecked,
except by the papal camera, and there was no public opinion
able, or as a rule any authority desirous, to prevent abuse.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a></p>

<p>A more serious matter than the exaction of fines
was the confiscation of property. This, strictly speaking,
was not a penalty, and technically also the Inquisition
was not responsible. The goods of the heretic were
simply sequestrated by the State automatically. So it
had been in the case of the Manichæans under the Roman
empire. It should, however, be noted that if the children
of a heretic were not themselves heretics, they were able
to succeed to his estate. It was otherwise in the case of
crimes, and in particular of treason, which involved the
complete, unconditional confiscation of the delinquent’s
estate. As the mediæval Church very plausibly reasoned
that heresy was a crime analogous to <i>majestas</i>, only more
heinous as being treason against the King of Kings, the
inference was obvious that heresy involved confiscation.
In his Decree of 1184, following the example of Alexander
III in 1163, who had enjoined on secular princes the
duty of imprisoning heretics and taking their property,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>Lucius III again declared confiscation of property to be
appropriate to heresy, but sought to obtain the benefit for
the Church. The practice as to the sharing of the spoils
of confiscation varied in different countries. Invariably,
as soon as anyone had been declared a heretic by the
Inquisition, the State at once sequestrated his property.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a>
In the south of France indeed the confiscation took place
even before—as soon as the suspect had been arrested or
cited. If the prisoner recanted or, in the latter case, if
the suspect were found guiltless, the property was then
restored. Innocent III’s fulmination regarding confiscation
had been vague in its terminology. What constituted the
degree of criminality punishable by confiscation? Did
the term ‘heretics’ mean only the obdurate, those who
had to be handed over to the State, or did it include
‘fautors’? The interpretation seems to have varied.
But the most common interpretation was that all those
whose offence was sufficiently heinous as to be ‘penanced’
by imprisonment, the contumacious who failed to answer
to citation and all those in whose houses heretics were
found, were liable to the confiscation of their property.
This seizing of estate before the termination of judicial
proceedings was obviously a heavy hardship, not only
upon the accused, but more especially upon his family.
In France the rules regarding confiscation were carried
out most remorselessly. Even before the accused had
been found guilty his wife and children might find
themselves turned adrift, dependent upon a charity which
it was dangerous to extend to those even indirectly
connected with heresy.<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> In France, also, the whole of
the confiscated property, once the royal power was strong
enough to insist upon this, went to the State. Confiscation
meant the entire loss of property, movable and
immovable, but there were certain exceptions. A wife
could claim to retain her dowry, but only on condition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>that she had not been cognizant of her husband’s heresy
when she married him.</p>

<p>Elsewhere it was otherwise. In <i>Ad extirpanda</i>, Innocent
IV laid down the rule that the proceeds were to be divided
into three equal portions, a third to go to the local authorities,
a third to the officials of the Inquisition, a third
to bishop and inquisitor.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> Latterly, in Italy, a different
tripartite division was made, the third which had originally
gone to bishop and inquisitor having to be paid to the
pope. The question of distribution was complicated by
feudal considerations, the feudal lord being able to put
forward a claim to any forfeited possessions of his vassal.
But, however much the allocation of these revenues might
vary, it was always understood that they were to be utilized
for the prosecution of the war against heresy, and in
particular the defraying of the expenses of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>The secular princes no doubt played their part.
They had every inducement to do so. It is always good
policy, if not to stimulate, at all events to preserve, the
goose that lays the golden eggs.<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> But, neither with
regard to the action of the secular princes nor of the
Inquisition, is it desirable to over-estimate the significance
of the pecuniary penances and penalties suffered by the
heretic. It is no doubt true that their importance used
to be under-estimated, when the tendency was to rivet
attention on the stake and torture-chamber in dealing
with the Inquisition. It is also true that the opportunity
of reaping mercenary profit from the prosecution of heresy
was an encouragement to cupidity. It is only in human
nature that it should be so. It may be true to say that
‘persecution, as a steady and continuous policy, rested,
after all, upon confiscation.’<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> But that is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>necessarily to say more than that the Inquisition had to
meet its expenses in some way or other; and it was
not unnatural to put to those expenses the proceeds of
pecuniary penalties imposed directly by, or indirectly
resulting from, the sentences of the tribunal. Confiscation
was a very customary expedient in the Middle Ages,
and once granted the Church’s reasonable analogy, on
its own premises, between heresy and treason, it was
an inevitable accompaniment of inquisitorial practice.
That extortion and avarice were likely to be excited by
the scheme is true; but to suggest avarice as a prime
motive in the prosecution of heresy is quite to overshoot
the mark.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> The Church did not embark upon the
destruction of Catharism because it coveted the wealth of
Cathari, but because it felt it must preserve itself against
a movement, which it regarded as anti-religious, anti-social
and immoral.<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> In the second place, it must be
remembered that the majority of mediæval heretical sects
consisted of poor men. Only rarely was a rich man a
heretic, and Fraticelli, Beguines, Dolcinists and most of
the later sects, ardently persecuted by the Inquisition
as they were, were certainly not worth pursuing from the
point of view of the material profit to be derived thereby.
Eymeric, lamenting the dearth of heretics of substance in
Spain in his day to help the tribunal to pay its way,
deals cursorily with the subject of confiscation as one
scarcely affecting the inquisitor at all.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a></p>

<p>The most severe of the inquisitorial penances was
that of imprisonment: but it is a <i>penance</i>. The idea is
that, left in solitude, where he is out of reach of heretical
contamination and has time to reflect on his offence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>where in the simple life sustained on bread and water
there are no worldly distractions, the penitent may be
enabled by the aid of ghostly counsel to make a sincere
return to the bosom of the Church. Bernard de Caux
used this penance frequently; it would appear that he
enjoined it upon all who did not voluntarily surrender
within the time of grace.<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> This was the ruling laid down
by the Council of Narbonne (1244), which ruthlessly
declared that no arguments of mercy against the infliction
were to be considered, such as the dependence of his
family upon the heretic, nor illness, nor old age. The
Council of Béziers, two years later, reiterated this principle,
but recommended lenience where the penance might
involve death to dependents. Imprisonment was also
frequently the penalty for failure to carry out penances
previously imposed. In the sentences of Bernard de
Caux a large percentage are for perpetual imprisonment.
In Languedoc, to meet the necessities of the battle with
Catharism, the Council of Narbonne ruled that imprisonment
should always be for life. The tribunal did not at
the time possess the resources to render the execution
of this order practicable. At a later period it appears
to have been carried out.</p>

<p>There were different degrees in the severity of the
imprisonment. The most lenient form, known as <i>murus
largus</i>, allowed of the prisoner’s leaving his cell, taking
exercise in the corridors and holding conversation with
other prisoners, similarly privileged, possibly also with
friends from outside the prison. Much less desirable was
the lot of the penitent consigned to <i>murus strictus</i>.
Placed in a cell of the smallest size and worst description,
dark and unsavoury, in some cases chained by both
hands and feet, he was not permitted ever to leave his
cell. This severer form of imprisonment was reserved
for those whose offence had been especially conspicuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>and therefore especially scandalous and dangerous to
the faith and for those whose confessions had not been
wholly satisfactory, complete and open.<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a></p>

<p>Mediæval prisons were all of them apt to be horrible
places, and it does not appear that those used by the
Inquisition were more noisome than others. That they
were terrible enough we know: as for example from the
report, as to the conditions in the <i>Cour de l’Inquisition</i> in
Carcassonne, made by the papal commissioners in 1305.<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a>
From other evidence it appears that harsh severity was
laid down as a rule for the treatment by gaolers of their
charges.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> And, as a general rule, there was little supervision
of the prisons, and their inmates had small chance
of redress against ill-treatment. Only the strong ventilation
of an alert public opinion can find its way into the
dark recesses of prison life: there was no public opinion
in the Middle Ages interested in the wrongs of the heretic.
It does not appear that there was separate accommodation
provided for those awaiting trial apart from the
condemned. It is only right to add, however, that
the Inquisition sanctioned the giving of presents of food
and drink, clothing and cash from outside friends to
the prisoners, so that they were not wholly dependent
upon the diet of bread and water, which was all that
the prisons provided.</p>

<p>The Inquisition was apt to find itself in difficulties
with regard to the funds necessary for the maintenance of
its prisoners. The prisons the tribunal itself built were
of the cheapest, and consequently of the most insanitary,
description. In France there were few specifically
inquisitorial prisons, those belonging to the secular and
episcopal authorities being utilized. Prior to the
absorption of Languedoc into the French monarchy
at the Peace of Paris, the cost of building and
maintaining prisons in that country had been borne
partly by the bishops, partly by the holders of confiscated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>property.<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> Probably after 1230 the lot of heretic
prisoners in Languedoc sensibly improved. In Italy the
Inquisition seems to have been able to meet such expenses
out of the proceeds of confiscation.</p>

<p>A penalty frequently met with in the early days
of the Inquisition is that of banishment. Originally
used in the Roman empire by the civil authority against
Arians, Nestorians, Manichæans, it was ordered by the
Council of Rheims in 1157 against heretics, incorporated
in the Assize of Clarendon, in the edict of Verona,
and in those of Alfonso II and Pedro II of Aragon.
On the surface it appeared an excellent method of ridding
a country of the contamination of heresy. But to
banish from one country was merely to introduce the
virus of the scourge into another. The effect was simply
to spread the epidemic. In the second place, banishment
was a confession of failure, as it gave no promise
of amendment upon the part of the individual: which
was ever the inquisitor’s object. Hence he preferred
imprisonment of the heretic to his banishment, holding
him fast to getting rid of him.</p>

<p>Heresy, being regarded as essentially anti-social,
involved exclusion from civil rights. The heretic could
hold no office in Church and State, could hold no title or
honour of any kind. If a father, his natural authority
over his children was rendered invalid; if a husband,
he no longer had legal authority over his wife; if a king,
he forfeited the obedience of his subjects; if a baron,
the vassalage of his tenants. He could not succeed
to property or, having it, leave it by will. His debtors
need pay him nothing. The incapacity to hold office
in the State affected not only the offender himself, but
descendants of the second generation in the paternal,
the first generation in the maternal, line.<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a></p>

<p>The idea of the taint of heresy is apparent in another
penalty which the inquisitor was competent to inflict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> the destruction of houses which had harboured heretical
inmates or been the scene of heretical meetings.<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a>
This penalty is less a punishment than a symbolical
act, expressive of the Church’s horror of heresy; an
attempt to blot out the very memory of the offence.
This practice, sanctioned in Roman law, was enjoined
by the Assize of Clarendon, by the Emperor Henry VI
in the edict of Prato of 1195, by Frederick II in
1232. It was consecrated by the Church in the days of
Innocent III. Innocent IV actually demanded the demolition,
not only of the house in which the heretic had been
found, but also of neighbouring houses, if they belonged
to the same property; a stringent rule modified by
Alexander IV. The houses must never be rebuilt, and
more, the places where they had stood must remain
unused for other building. There was just one saving
clause: the stones of the demolished houses might be
used for pious purposes.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> Had these regulations been
literally carried out, it is obvious that whole towns might
have been devastated and remained waste. But it is
evident that the rules were not fulfilled to the letter.
They were made to apply in Languedoc to houses in
which definite heretical acts had taken place, such as
the Catharan heretication. Even so, the secular arm
was not disposed to approve of a penalty which not
only did material damage, but diminished the yield of
confiscations. Both France and Germany protested;
and eventually the inquisitors agreed to issue licences
to build on the sites of the demolished houses.<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a></p>

<p>So far we have dealt, on the whole, with penalties
incurred by those who, in the end, became reconciled
to the Church—those who confessed, performed their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>penance in token of contrition and promised amendment.
But there were also those who did not become
reconciled. They fall under three headings—the
contumacious, the impenitent, the relapsed.</p>

<p>As regards the first, the Inquisition adopted the
rule of Roman law. If the accused, being cited three
times or given one peremptory summons to appear,
failed to do so, he was reckoned as contumacious. The
penalty was excommunication and forfeiture of goods.
This sentence would be annulled in the event of the
accused’s surrendering himself to the tribunal within the
space of a year from the date of the citation.<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> Otherwise,
he was liable, on falling into the hands of the Inquisition,
as an excommunicate, to be handed over to the secular
arm.</p>

<p>With the stubborn impenitent, resisting up to the
last all efforts of the Church to bring him back to her
bosom, there was obviously nothing to be done. But
the inquisitor, to whom relaxation to the secular arm
was an admission of defeat, left no means untried, of
persuasion, admonition, force, to avoid such failure.
His reluctance to hand over the heretic as a hopeless
recalcitrant, was in most cases perfectly genuine. Even
after the sentence of relaxation had been pronounced,
indeed after the culprit had actually been handed over,
the slightest sign of willingness to repent might suffice
to save the victim.<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> Eymeric mentions one case in
which a heretic, consigned to the flames at Barcelona,
being scorched on one side, cried out in his agony
that he would recant, and was at once removed from
the fire.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></p>

<p>The relapsed were those who, having once erred and
been received back into communion, sinned in the same
way again. These were incorrigible. Their former
repentance had manifestly been a mere sham, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>outrage cried to heaven. Repetition of the sin of heresy
could not be suffered.<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> Accordingly the relapsed were
the only class of offenders coming before the Holy Office
who could not save themselves by penitence. Relapse
came to involve relaxation automatically. But it had
not been so at first, perpetual imprisonment being the
penalty originally enjoined, for example by the Councils
of Tarragona and Béziers. By 1258, however, relaxation
had come to be recognized as the sole possible reward
for relapse.<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a></p>

<p>Relaxation to the secular arm meant death, and death
by burning. The inquisitor himself, who did not and
could not pronounce a death sentence, knew, on the
other hand, that a sentence of relaxation was tantamount
to one of death.</p>

<p>It is true that he made use of a formula,<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> expressing
a desire that lenience might be shown to the victim;
and that some apologists have based upon this the
contention that the ecclesiastical tribunal was in no
way responsible for the death penalty; urging, on the
one hand, that the desire that the relaxed heretic might
not suffer either death or mutilation was perfectly genuine,
on the other that the lay authority was entirely independent
in the matter, pronouncing and executing its
own sentence, based on a decision of its own, not the
Inquisition’s relaxation; and that, should it decide to
spare the life of the heretic, the Church would make
no complaint, but quite the contrary.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a></p>

<p>The theory cannot be accepted. The attitude of
Gregory IX and Innocent IV towards Frederick II’s
Constitutions, and the bulls, <i>Cum adversus haereticam</i> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span><i>Ad extirpanda</i>, are really decisive in the matter.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> But
there is additional clear proof that the formula of leniency
was an empty formula, intended merely to preserve
technical conformity with the Canon.<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> In the first place,
what appropriate punishment for the contumacious,
the impenitent, the relapsed could there be short of
death? Even the contrite heretic, received back into
the fold, may have to undergo so severe a penance as
perpetual imprisonment. If the Church metes out to
the contrite punishment as severe as the impenitent
has to face, she is putting a premium upon impenitence.
The simple fact that perpetual imprisonment is numbered
among the penances inflicted by the Inquisition is proof
positive that the Inquisition desired and anticipated
from the secular arm the death penalty for those relaxed
to it. For careless as to the ultimate fate of the
impenitent the Church cannot possibly be. She cannot
be willing that he should go free to rejoice in the triumph
of his obduracy among confederates and to spread contagion
among the faithful. Shall he be banished by
the secular authority? To what end? Banishment
only means the spread of infection. Shall he, then, be
imprisoned by the secular authority? Again, to what
end? The Inquisition can imprison as well as the
State. It is a strange obtuseness that does not see
that the whole attitude of the Inquisition to the heretic
points logically, and indeed inevitably, to death as the
fate of the obdurate. The tribunal had been created,
and it existed, to the end that heresy might be exterminated.
To have failed to secure that those who to
the last resisted all its most strenuous efforts to obtain
confession and reconciliation must expect a worse fate
than those who proved compliant would have stultified
its very existence.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the Church saw to it, that the
penalty meted out by the secular arm to the relaxed
was death. Hardly ever did the secular ruler show any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>reluctance to inflict it. But if he forbore, he would
probably be excommunicated.<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> Ever after the Fourth
Council of the Lateran the Church made it incumbent
upon the lay power to carry out the imperial edicts
against heresy. The formula of mercy, then, may be
called either a ‘legal fiction’ or bluntly, a ‘hypocrisy’:
it was never intended to be taken literally.<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> The
scrupulous regard of the Church for regularity in accordance
with the Canon showed susceptibility to decorum;
as a repudiation of moral responsibility it would have
been contemptible.</p>

<p>But the mediæval Church did not repudiate such
responsibility, as some of its modern apologists have
sought to do. Had it disapproved of the penalty of
death for the obdurate heretic, it both could and would
have said so. Nay, more. It possessed the authority
and practical power to have prevented it. To doubt
that is to attribute to the mediæval Church infinitely
less influence than it actually possessed. A papacy,
claiming and at times exercising authority in matters
temporal as well as spiritual, could have brought pressure
to bear upon the secular power in a matter peculiarly
the Church’s concern. The fact that it never made
any attempt to do so is proof that it never desired to.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the Church in the Middle Ages
felt no such squeamishness, as is natural in these modern
days of religious toleration, regarding the drastic punishment
of errors <i>in intellectu</i>. Once granted the point of
view that heresy is a more heinous offence than coining—to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>use St. Thomas’ analogy—or than treason, to use
a commoner and more forcible comparison, and the
penalty of death for heresy appears not shocking and
horrible, but something eminently just and proper.
We may take St. Thomas as representative of the best
thought of the Church on the subject in the Middle
Ages. Later inquisitors were quite unequivocal in
their language. ‘Pertinax non tantum est relaxandus,
sed etiam vivus a saeculari potestate conburendus.’<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a>
Simancas, likewise, has no qualms. The best human
law demands the burning of the heretic; in this according
with the divine law. Christ is quoted in proof. ‘Igne
igitur extirpanda est haeretica pubis: ne nobis
Deus irascitur, si haereticos dimittimus impunitos.’<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a>
A favourite line of argument was that adopted by
Ludovico à Paramo, in comparing the Church to the
ark of Noah. As God utterly destroyed the unbelievers
outside the Ark by a deluge, so now does he destroy
the heretic.<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> It is modern humanitarianism, not
Inquisitorial authorities, that seeks to disclaim moral
responsibility for the stake.</p>

<p>The outward and visible sign of the Church’s approval
was its participation in the ceremony of execution.
This took place frequently as part of a great and elaborate
function known as the <i>sermo generalis</i> or ‘act of faith’—the
<i>auto-da-fé</i> of the Spanish Inquisition. There could
be a <i>sermo generalis</i> without an execution. A burning
was not the essential feature of the ceremony. The
<i>auto</i> had humble beginnings. In the early days of the
Inquisition in Toulouse there might be one every week or
so. In rapid, business-like fashion the sentences against
heretics were pronounced in the presence of the civil
and ecclesiastical officers. But in course of time the
proceedings came to be much more elaborate, the object
being to impress the popular mind. The <i>sermo generalis</i>
usually took place on a Sunday and inside a church,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>a platform being erected upon which the culprits were
placed. The ceremony, which started in the early
morning, began with a sermon appropriate to the
occasion, preached by an inquisitor. After this an
indulgence was announced for all who had come to take
part in the solemnity; the civil magistrates took an
oath of fidelity, and excommunication was fulminated
against all who had in any way thwarted the Inquisition
in the pursuance of its labours. Next the confessions
of the penitents were read, followed by the recital of
the form of abjuration, which they repeated word by
word. It does not appear that they wore any such
distinctive garb as was customary in the Spanish
Inquisition of later days. The inquisitor then absolved
the penitents from the excommunication which their
heresy had incurred, the formal sentences were read
out, first in Latin, then in the vulgar tongue; after
which the culprits were brought forward in order corresponding
with the degree of their guilt, beginning with
the least guilty and ending with the impenitent and
relapsed. For the disposal of the latter adjournment
was made to another place, where they were handed
over to the lay authorities. The victims destined to
pay the last penalty were not at once executed. It
was not seemly that the execution should take place
on a Sunday, and they were given another night to make
their peace with God. The following day they were
brought to the stake, accompanied by ghostly comforters,
who would earnestly exhort them to penitence, seeing
that, except in the case of the relapsed, reconciliation
was possible up to the last moment. They were forbidden
to exhort the victims to quiet submission for fear that
this might suggest that they were doing something to
expedite the punishment in store for the heretics.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a></p>

<p>This would have been an irregularity. Yet so
implicitly did the Church believe in death for the obstinate
heretic, that she pursued his body even after death.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>
<p>For death did not terminate heresy; and it was
evidently felt to be obnoxious that anyone who had
been a heretic, even though his heresy had never been
detected during life, should pass beyond the reach of
ecclesiastical justice. Notwithstanding the pronouncement
of Ivo of Chartres that the powers of the Church
extended only to the present world, by the middle of
the thirteenth century it seems to have been generally
recognized that the corpses of all persons, whose heresy
was discovered only after their demise, were to be dug
up and disposed of in accordance with the degree of
their guilt.<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> In 1209 a synod at Paris caused the body
of Amaury de Bène to be flung to the dogs, and in 1237
the bodies of certain heretic nobles were carried through
the streets of Toulouse and solemnly burnt.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> The
practice seems to have been partly due to a popular
feeling that it was a dreadful and scandalous thing that
a heretic should be buried in consecrated ground, partly
to a desire on the part of the inquisitors to demonstrate
their implacable zeal and unlimited power.<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a></p>

<p>All inquisitorial sentences, with the single exception of
death—which, strictly speaking, was not an inquisitorial
sentence at all—could be, and frequently were, commuted.
Thus for imprisonment is substituted the wearing of
crosses in view of the penitent’s having given information
about a plot against the inquisitor’s life. The
procuring of the capture of other heretics is similarly
rewarded.<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> Commutation to a lighter penance is
allowed to a woman, because she has a number of small
children; to a man, because he has a wife and family
dependent upon him.<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> Such unconditional remitments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>were rare; temporary alleviations were more frequent.<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a>
Penitents might be allowed to leave prison, for periods
varying from a few weeks to two years, on account of
child-birth or illness.<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> A husband and wife, both in prison
for heresy, might be allowed access to one another.<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a></p>

<p>A right of appeal existed, from the bishop to the
metropolitan, from the inquisitor to the Pope. The
papacy was at first averse to receiving appeals in cases
of heresy, Lucius III in 1185 declaring that he would
have none of them.<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> When, however, the Inquisition
was established, the right was acknowledged. But it
was at best of doubtful and partial utility. It was a
condition that the appeal must be lodged before the
sentence was pronounced. In other words there
could be no appeal against a decision of the tribunal.
It was valid only as against an alleged injustice in procedure.<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a>
A complaint on the latter ground could easily
be rectified by the inquisitors themselves by the simple
device of starting the process anew and carefully avoiding
the irregularity of which complaint was made. If the
inquisitors regarded the appeal as frivolous, they could
dismiss it. It is clear that they regarded all appeals
as a nuisance, an unwarrantable embarrassment.<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> The
most successful appeals lodged against the tribunal
were those brought by powerful nobles and influential
towns.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> For the ordinary person, devoid of influence,
the right of appeal offered small hope of deliverance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>We have valuable evidence as to the comparative
frequency of the various penances prescribed by the
Inquisition. The practice of different inquisitors varied,
as was inevitable, when so much was left to the arbitrary
decision of the individual judge. But a general
computation is possible. Imprisonment, confiscation of
property, the wearing of crosses are the sentences that
occur most frequently. No inquisitor in the Middle
Ages was more vigorous and efficient than Bernard Gui.
In a collection of sentences extending over a period
of seventeen years, 1308-23, there are 307 of imprisonment,
143 of wearing crosses, 69 of exhumation, 9 of
pilgrimages without the wearing of crosses, 40 of condemnation
of fugitives as contumacious, 45 of relaxation
to the secular arm; <i>i.e.</i> only 45 sentences of relaxation
out of 613.<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> Another veritable ‘hammer of heretics,’
Bernard de Caux, has left voluminous records of his
cases between the years 1246 and 1248. There are a
large number of sentences of life imprisonment; not
a single mention of relaxation.<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> This is very remarkable,
as it seems highly unlikely that Bernard de Caux
never came across an impenitent in the course of his
duties, and the suggestion is at least plausible that the
records are incomplete, being only entries of sentences
of imprisonment.<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> But the clear indication of the
evidence is that the number of cases of relaxation must
have been comparatively small in the aggregate and
very small in comparison with other sentences.</p>

<p>This may appear strange to those whose sole idea of
the Inquisition is that of a court mainly concerned with
the burning of heretics. Such a conception rests upon
a misunderstanding of the object and function of the
tribunal. It did not aim at making great holocausts
of victims; it desired only to make a few examples.
Except in Languedoc, where the heretics were in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>majority and powerful, a few examples always sufficed.
It sought not vengeance, which was a synonym for
failure, but reconciliation, which meant success. More
characteristic of the Inquisition than its sentences of
relaxation, with their attendant horrible consequence,
in reality more effective and perhaps more terrible, was
its whole method of procedure, its use of torture, moral
as well as physical, the agony of the rack and the nervous
strain of prolonged and tortuous examination, its
utilization of the humiliation of the cross-wearing, of
the dull and hopeless misery of harsh and lengthy imprisonment,
by which the spirit of the victim was broken
and the purity of the faith preserved.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI - CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>The story of mediæval heresy is but a chapter in a much
larger subject, that of the slow and painful development
of religious tolerance and freedom of thought.
Heresy—essentially free choice in the sphere of religious
belief in contradistinction to implicit obedience to
doctrinal authority—was a serious problem to the Church
in the early centuries of the Christian era. During
the long, distracted and desolate epoch of the barbarian
invasions it ceased to be a potent factor in history. But
when Europe recovered from the malady, the lethargy
of the Dark Ages, and the human mind was again awake,
it became once more a problem. The rationalistic
speculations of Eriugena, Roscellinus and Berengar;
the disordered ravings of Tanchelm; the aggressive
anti-sacerdotalism of the Cathari or Paulicians, and of
the vagrant Waldenses, present us with the three outstanding
types of mediæval heresy. By far the most
influential, those which the Church recognized as the
most hurtful and dangerous, were the last. In the case
of the Cathari there was a clear and a very remarkable
revival of a heresy that had much afflicted the
early Church, Manichæism. Their dualist theology was
hopelessly pessimistic; their practical teachings a mere
gospel of despair. The crude dualism and perverted
antinomianism of the sect contained little indeed that
either merited respect or promised lasting influence.
Only in the hint of a genuine hatred of the gross and
the cruel was there aught to respect; only in its Donatist
doctrine and its denunciation of the Catholic clergy
was there the likelihood of lasting influence. In their
hostility to the claims, and their diatribes against the
abuses, of the clergy, Paulicianism and Waldensianism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
stood united. These two heresies gave a popular currency
in the lands where they secured a foothold to anti-sacerdotalism,
which involved not only the condemnation
of all backsliding on the part of the clergy from the
strictest and most rigid interpretation of the Christ-like
life, but also—as the result of this—the rejection of the
doctrinal basis of the peculiar privileges of the clergy,
namely the conception of the mediatorial character of
the priesthood. The Arnoldist ‘Poor Men’; the Petrobrusians,
insisting on the sole efficacy of the individual’s
own faith, unaided by churches and sacraments; the
Henricians in their ascetic denunciation of clerical worldliness
and rejection of the sacraments; the Poor Men of
Lyons, adopting the rule of absolute poverty, preaching
in streets and countryside because, although illiterate,
they were conscious of an inward vocation, and so being
led on to undertake other priestly functions though
unordained; the Cathari asserting that the Catholic
Church was lost in materialism and worldliness and
that <i>they</i> were the true church of Christ—all these
were inherently the aggressive enemies of the priesthood.
There was a similar note in much of the popular
poetry in those southern lands in which these
heresies took firmest root. It is a note scornful, defiant,
often ribald and profane, that comes into the songs
of the goliards and troubadours. With a robust and
crude Rabelaisianism they burlesque, not only clerical
manners, but the holiest ceremonies and the most sacred
doctrines. Even in miracles and mystery plays the note
is sometimes heard; in the poems of Rutebeuf, the
‘Roman de la Rose’ and ‘Reynard the Fox,’ it is most
resonant. In the popular poetry there is undoubtedly
something of the unconsecrated paganism of the average
man—his innate secularism rebelling against clerical
privilege, when it is not fortified by personal worthiness.
Yet between the Provençal troubadour and the Paulician
heretic there was something akin; and with the nobleman
of Languedoc, only too willing to take the excuse
for despoiling the clergy, they were alike popular. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
may regret the total extinction of the exotic, semi-Moorish
culture of southern France, which the Albigensian
crusades involved; we need not regret the virtual extinction,
with it, of the heresies.<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> If there was something
worthy of esteem in their demand for spiritual reality
and personal holiness, this was confused with other
elements, which were perverted and absurd, sometimes
even repulsive and abominable. On their constructive
side the heresies of Waldenses and Albigenses had nothing
of genuine value to offer. In so far as they have
significance, it is because of their anti-clerical elements,
which are in part a cause, but more a symptom, of a
trend of popular sentiment.</p>

<p>The second type of mediæval heresy is that represented
by Tanchelm, Eon de l’Etoile, Segarelli, Dolcino, the
Flagellants. It belongs to the province, not of the
theologian but of the psychologist, specially interested
in the study of depraved emotion and diseased
imagination. Its foundation is that perverted sexuality
which is so strangely connected, as a matter of
psychological fact, with intensity of religious enthusiasm.
The cases of Tanchelm and Eon are no doubt cases of
simple religious mania. None of the heresies of this
type had, or from their character was at all likely
to have, any but the most fleeting results. They have,
nevertheless, their interest, as symptoms of the powerful
emotionalism which seemed equally liable to produce
a fierce animalism or an intense religious asceticism.
The same raw material of unregenerate sense and passion
gave to the Church saints and heresiarchs. Ever in the
Middle Ages there was a tendency to excess, excess of
self-abnegation, excess of self-indulgence, a tendency
to push ideas both of doctrine and conduct to extremes.
Thus did the Spiritual Franciscans tend to see in their
founder a superman, to make the cult of poverty an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>obsession, to believe themselves a new order destined
to inaugurate the era of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>The third type of mediæval heresy is of an altogether
different nature. It is intellectual, philosophic. In all
the other heresies there is a taint of rottenness, disease.
Here, on the other hand, there is the health and sanity
of honest thinking—and though the thought be crude,
obscure or exaggerated, there is at least the possibility of
lasting results. In the re-discovery and re-absorption of
the intellectual heritage of classical and patristic times
there was always the danger of heresy. The process of
adapting knowledge, pagan in source, coming sometimes
through infidel channels, was certainly perilous. It has
to be remembered that it was the Church that initiated
and carried through this process; that to the Church the
world is indebted for the Renaissance of the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries. But the process inevitably presented
serious problems. In the first place, it yielded a copious
mass of new comment and interpretation upon the
original body of Christian dogma, viewed from a
philosophic standpoint. Apply the logical methods of
scholasticism and envisage dogma in the light of the
metaphysical problem of the relations between the
universal and the particular, and you have to decide
whether the realist, the nominalist or the conceptualist
is the true interpreter of the creeds. The difficulty was
increased with the advent of Aristotelianism in the
thirteenth century. One exposition of Aristotle was
definitely declared to be heresy—that of the Averrhoïsts.
But the Augustinian opponents of St. Thomas Aquinas
endeavoured to confound him in the charge of heresy:
and it was for a time doubtful whether Aristotelianism
in any shape or form could be accepted as orthodox.
Not only Alberto-Thomists in their attack upon the
Averrhoïsts, but secular clergy warring with regulars,
Franciscans inveighing against Dominicans, all glibly
brought the convenient accusation of heresy against
their opponents. It was for lawful authority to determine
categorically what was orthodox, what heretical.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
But no authority was, as a matter of fact, impartial or
certain to be final. Authority, whether papal, conciliar
or academic, was itself wedded to one school of thought
or another, swayed by the predominant philosophy of its
own passing day.</p>

<p>It was not only a question of new ways of regarding,
new interpretations of, existing dogma. There was also
the problem presented by new dogmas, such as those
of the Beatific Vision and the Immaculate Conception.
Such tenets were not in themselves either inherently
orthodox or heretical. When a creed is stabilized,
completely rigid, it is easy to be exactly faithful to it;
but when it is fluid, even for the most orthodox of intent,
safety can only be found in caution.</p>

<p>But the chief potential source of trouble in the
intellectual ferment of scholasticism lay in the fact that it
inevitably placed side by side two different authorities, the
objective authority of the Church as enshrined in Scripture,
tradition, papal and other lawful ecclesiastical <i>dicta</i>, and,
on the other hand, the subjective authority of the human
reason. All discussion, all argument is necessarily an
appeal largely to this second authority. While the
great majority of the scholastics only used reason in
order to justify revealed truth and never questioned the
superiority of the infallible, the divine authority of the
Church over the fallible authority of man’s intellect, there
were others, such as Eriugena and Abelard, who placed
reason first. Finally, there came a scholastic in Wycliffe,
whose realism led him into dangerous errors, not only
subversive of the cardinal doctrine of transubstantiation,
but also threatening the whole status and mediatorial
character of the priesthood.</p>

<p>It is most important to remember that the scholastic
philosophers were in all cases clerics, representative of,
and not antagonistic to, Catholic theology; that even the
Averrhoïsts were also clerics, having no desire to break
with the Church. On the other hand, the freedom of
thought which the universities stood for and dialectic
fostered, and which the Church not only did not repress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
but even encouraged, had a tendency to produce heresy.
Realism evolved pantheism; nominalism unitarianism.
The intellectual influences of university life brought
forth Gerson, D’Ailly and the other whole-hearted
reformers who made the great effort at revival of the
Church from within which failed at Constance and Basel;
but it also brought forth Wycliffe and Hus, whom those
Councils condemned. It was never absolutely clear
where the dividing line between orthodoxy and heresy
would rest. However much they might be reconciled
or confused, the ideals and methods of theology and
philosophy cannot be the same. The postulates of the one
are not those of the other; and the more the scientific
spirit is developed, the fewer the postulates of any sort
that it is ready to accept. The Averrhoïsts at least saw
this, only saving their position by the equivocation of
the double truth.</p>

<p>Which was really the more dangerous to Catholic
doctrine—the organized heresies, as a rule ignorant,
perverted, having the seeds of their own destruction in
their very rottenness, which the Church did systematically
persecute; or the philosophical speculations of the
universities, with their temptations to rationalism which
the Church in the main tolerated?<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> Each produced
a force not wholly transient—a force operative in the
breaking up of the mediæval system. The first was
anti-sacerdotalism; the second a habit of independent
thought and criticism. It is true that the anti-sacerdotalism
of Luther and the secular spirit of Renaissance
humanism, with its entire indifference to religion,
were the decisive factors in breaking up the fabric of
mediævalism, and the movements of Lutheranism and
humanism were largely new creations. Yet Luther owed
much to Hus, and Hus everything to Wycliffe, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>scholastic, and the detached attitude of the Italian
humanist was only one step in advance of that of the
Latin Averrhoïst. Neither the wandering sectaries,
in part suggesting, in part merely articulating, an antisacerdotal
sentiment, nor the philosophers with their
speculations concerning universals and the ultimate
cause of being, were without influence in bringing about
the collapse of the mediæval structure.</p>

<p>It is of no use studying the question of the attitude
of the mediæval Church towards heresy unless one is
prepared to use imagination enough to envisage heresy
from the mediæval point of view. Men’s mental outlook
is governed by the intellectual conditions of their
own day. A few individuals may be, as the phrase goes,
‘in advance of their time’; but at the best they form
only a small minority. To consider abstractly the rights
and wrongs, the advantages and disadvantages of institutions
and systems is the function of the philosopher.
But the historian, while not ignoring the abstract question,
has specifically the function of ascertaining what, in point
of fact, people’s opinions have been and why they formed
them. Much that has been written on the subject of
religious toleration is of only limited validity because it
simply denounces, and does not attempt to explain or
to appreciate, the psychology of intolerance.<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> Thus, for
example, Locke’s ‘Letters on Toleration’ have little
<i>argumentative</i> value, because they are based on a complete
<i>ignoratio elenchi</i>. Religious toleration is a great principle,
but many modern dithyrambs on the inalienable right
of liberty of thought and conscience fall rather wide
of the mark, can convince only the already converted.
It is not very profitable to bring forward the theory of the
indefeasible right of free thought in condemnation of
mediæval society—to the whole of which, and by no
means to its clerical elements only, the conception of
such a right was entirely foreign. After all, even to-day the
belief in an absolute toleration is held by only a very few,
and even these anarchists will usually be found to hold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>it with certain reservations.<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> Organized society cannot
tolerate the forces which are subversive of it. It does
not tolerate the criminal. ‘A universal and absolute
toleration of everything and everybody would lead to a
general chaos as certainly as a universal and absolute
intolerance.’<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> It is undoubtedly true that a certain
measure of ‘intolerance is essential to all that is, or moves,
or lives, for tolerance of destructive elements within the
organism amounts to suicide.’<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a> The individual possesses
rights in so far as they are not prejudicial to the welfare
of his fellows and the interests of the entire community.
And the recognition that the maintenance of social
order was perfectly compatible with the acknowledgment
of the right of individual opinion and the permission
of diversity of views, this in the Middle Ages ‘was a
discovery to be made, not a truth to be proved.’<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a></p>

<p>For the Middle Ages religion was not divorced from
the secular life. The <i>Respublica Christiana</i> was an unity
and a potent reality. The common faith was the panoply
of the State. Devotion to it was an integral part of
patriotism, and the counterpart of loyalty to the secular
prince and of obedience to his laws. The man, therefore,
who assailed the faith assailed society; in cutting himself
off from the Church he outlawed himself from the State.
Acknowledgment of the sacred truths of Christianity
was the foundation of all morality. The mediæval
mind could not conceive of morality apart from religion.
Hence respect for the divine law, as revealed in the
Scripture and the Church, was regarded as the sole
guarantee for the security of ordered society. Heresy
was considered as essentially anti-social, anarchic; was
conceived of as analogous to false coining or treason.
Only to falsify truth was more heinous than to falsify the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>coin and treason against God than treason against man.
The exposition of the nature of heresy in Ludovico à
Paramo is most logical. The character of a state depends
on its religion; the faith is the foundation of the state.<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a>
Heretics cannot dwell in harmony with Catholics: for if
difference of language severs, how much more difference
of belief?<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> Heresy is productive of all manner of vice
and immorality, which are antagonistic to order and
government.<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a></p>

<p>To the Church all this was self-evident. How could
she stand neutral as between truth and falsehood, and
treat them as if on an equality? She found all the strong
walls and bastions, defences of the theocratic city, of
which she was the appointed warden, being attacked by
an insidious enemy within the gates. She had the power
to defend; how could she be justified if she held her hand?
The heretic questioned her credentials, turned her claims
to ridicule, threatened to bring down the whole structure
of the Christian polity to the ground. Both in self-defence
and in common loyalty to her mission she must
strike. All the intensity of religious conviction inspired
to persecution. Tolerance, argues de Maistre, only
indicates religious indifference.<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> Moreover, the mediæval
churchman was inevitably much influenced by the injunctions
of the Old Testament. The Church succeeded
to the heritage of the synagogue.<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a></p>

<p>But it was not the Church only that was persuaded
of the essentially dangerous and anti-social character of
heresy. Partly, no doubt, as the result of the Church’s
teaching through many generations, but certainly of
their own accord and not as the result of any direct
instruction, both secular rulers and the ordinary laity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>were equally convinced.<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> They all lived in a thoroughly
theocratic atmosphere. The prince sincerely saw in
the heretic an enemy of all authority, and therefore
of his own.<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> Secular legislation was just as unequivocal
in its treatment of heresy as was Canon law. To the
ordinary layman the heretic appeared as a thoroughly
cross-grained, cantankerous, dangerous person, certainly
of some immoral propensities and perhaps sexually
perverted.<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a></p>

<p>Such was the mediæval point of view; and, once
granted the necessary premises, it is extremely logical
and exceedingly hard to combat. Now-a-days we do
not accept those premises; but in the Middle Ages
we should probably not have dreamed of questioning
them. On the extraordinarily interesting and important
question of the causes of this change of attitude
authorities do, and are likely to, differ, though many
students will agree in combining their conclusions. To
those who, like John Stuart Mill and Lecky for instance,
attribute religious persecution almost entirely to the
doctrine of exclusive salvation, the causes of the growth
of tolerance will appear to be the extension of the
sceptical spirit and the process of the secularization of
politics.<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> Others, such as Bishop Creighton (who will
not agree that persecution is to be explained by the
doctrine of exclusive salvation at all),<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> or as Sir F. Pollock
(who classifies different types of intolerance—tribal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>political, social), insist strongly upon the simple factor
of experience. ‘It is not the demonstration of abstract
rights, but the experience of inutility, that has made
governments leave off persecuting.’<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> After all, the
great justification of liberty of thought lies not in the
attempted demonstration of a natural right, but in
the records of the painful process whereby toleration has
been achieved.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> It would have saved an infinity of bloodshed
and misery, would have freed the palimpsest of
history of some of its most terrible blots, could the principle
of toleration have been established without that awful
struggle. But none of the great triumphs of mankind
have been achieved save after centuries of effort, loss
and failure.</p>

<p>To the moral judgment of our own day no instrument
of persecution seems more odious than the Inquisition.
Protestants have persecuted just as whole-heartedly as
Catholics, and with far less excuse; but the Inquisition
stands by itself, as a regular specialized tribunal for
persecution, immensely efficient, with an existence of
centuries to its record.<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a> We have seen the way in which
the Inquisition came into being. Both the circumstances
of its origin and the intentions of its various founders
gave the tribunal a character only semi-judicial. Indeed,
if we object that the Inquisition was a bad court
of justice, its originators could retort with truth that
it was not intended to be a simple court of justice.
The Inquisition was created to deal with erring
children, not criminals; not merely to pronounce
a verdict, but to produce reconciliation and amendment;
not to punish, but to penance. The Church, through
the Inquisition, was dealing in the spirit of a parent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>with her own children, over whom she had all a parent’s
rights of discipline and chastisement, but also evincing
a parent’s deep desire for something more than justice
and punishment, for the ending of estrangement and the
restoration of loving union in the family. Such was the
pure theory of the Inquisition, a much more benignant conception
than that of the ordinary law-court. In the latter,
the mere fact of repentance would not avail; in the former,
if it were sincere, it availed everything. So de Maistre,
defending the Spanish Inquisition, declared it to be the
most lenient, the most merciful tribunal in the world.</p>

<p>But we have to consider the point of view, not only
of the judge, but of the defendant. Whatever the
real nature of the tribunal, the man brought before it
was on his trial. The tribunal <i>did</i> pronounce a verdict,
and upon that verdict his reputation, perhaps his freedom
or his life, depended. He wanted justice, not mercy:
and the Inquisition might be lenient, but it was not
fair. It was radically unfair. It gave no facilities
whatever for the plea of Not Guilty. It cared nought
for the reputation of the accused. He had already lost
his reputation by being before the court at all. The
very fact of defamation, of being ‘suspect’ inferred
guilt. To leave the court of the Inquisition without a
stain upon one’s character was virtually impossible. In
all manner of ways the accused was at a disadvantage—in
the suppression of the names of witnesses and of
evidence, in the refusal of legal assistance, in the use of
torture, and above all in the fact that the judge was also
the prosecutor, who regarded it as perfectly legitimate
to browbeat and confuse the defendant, if he was so
misguided and unfilial as to endeavour to defend himself.
Inquisitorial procedure was a miserable travesty of justice;
and its mercifulness was forthcoming only on its own terms.
To all save the meekly submissive the Inquisition typified
not mercy and love, but remorselessness and cruelty.</p>

<p>While in studying the origins of the Inquisition
we are bound to examine, and to seek to understand,
the point of view of those who were responsible for its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
inception, in estimating its character and results we
need not, nay we <i>ought</i> not, to judge by any other
criterion than that dictated by the highest conceptions
of right and justice. The common, the accepted, standard
of to-day both as regards justice and humanity is, happily,
greatly higher than that of the Middle Ages. Much
that has been written of the Inquisition has been vitiated
by an attempt to read into the mind and conduct of
men of mediæval times a humanitarianism which is the
peculiar product of the modern world, and which they
could not even have understood. Even more vitiated
would be any thesis which, not satisfied with justifying
the originators of the Inquisition, sought to justify the
institution itself. Certainly the motive for such an
attempt could not be impartiality. Only moral obliquity
can be blind to the transparent abominations of
inquisitorial procedure.</p>

<p>If its character as a tribunal was essentially evil,
evil also were some of the Inquisition’s results. Secular
princes discerned its remarkable potential utility to
themselves and regarded it with envy and admiration.
Its methods had a satisfactory efficiency found in no other
court. By such methods conviction could be practically
assured. The charge of heresy could therefore be
preferred against political enemies with the happiest
prospects of advantage. The destruction for purely
political ends was achieved by the use of inquisitorial
methods of the Templars, Jeanne d’Arc, Savonarola.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>
<p>Those are the most notorious, but there are other
instances of this abuse of the sacred tribunal for purely
secular, and sometimes base and immoral, purposes.</p>

<p>Worse still—and possibly this is the worst aspect
of the whole story of the Inquisition—its pernicious
methods of procedure were borrowed by the admiring
secular princes for their courts, which did not pretend
to have the double nature which was the explanation,
if not the excuse, for the Inquisition’s adoption of its
system. Thus civil courts in Europe came to be
tarnished by the system of <i>inquisitio</i>, the secret enquiry,
the heaping up of disabilities for the defence, the application
of torture—all these abuses having the august
sanction of ecclesiastical use. The lay authority could
triumphantly vindicate such innovations, whereby justice
became an unequal contest between authority, combining
the two characters of prosecutor and judge, and
the unhappy prisoner, by pointing to the example of the
Church, the repository of the sublime truths of divine
justice and Christian charity. To the fortunate fact
that the Inquisition never secured a footing in the British
Islands is largely due their maintenance, in contradistinction
to Continental states, of the open trial and
of the great maxim that no one is presumed to be guilty,
that the onus of proof lies with the prosecution. It
was not the fault of the Church that the secular power
admired and imitated the methods of the Holy Office;
but it is surely a calamity that it should have been able
to find in an ecclesiastical tribunal a system which must
seem to every fair-minded man to-day so abhorrent to
the whole spirit and tenor of the Christian gospel.</p>

<p>No attempt has been made in these pages to present
the heresies of the Middle Ages in any heroic light, to
slur over the pernicious crudities of many of them. As
between the spiritual and intellectual ideals represented
by the mediæval Church and those represented by the
majority of the sectaries the choice is self-evident.
Wycliffites and Husites stand obviously on a far higher
plane, but Petrobrusians, Cathari, Dolcinists, Flagellants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
and many others had no fertile ideas to bequeath to a
later day and were, at best perhaps, a nuisance in their
own. Yet it has to be remembered that not only noble-minded
men like Hus and Jerome of Prague, whose creed,
whether true or not, was in any case sane and pure and
exalted, but also innumerable others, whom we know
only as names in inquisitorial records, who whatever
the faith they professed stood constant through physical
and mental anguish, to perish perhaps at the last at
the stake in a world barren of pity with no friendly
faces to encourage them—these suffered for a great ideal,
that of fidelity to the spirit of truthfulness, of intellectual
integrity. All who have died rather than be false to
themselves and their vision of truth, thus demonstrating
to the world their conviction that belief is worth dying
for—whether Catholics or Protestants or the most erring
of mediæval heretics—have done service to the cause of
human progress. For, if it be true that only through the
tragic experience of centuries of religious persecution could
mankind attain to the establishment of the principle
of liberty of thought and conscience, then every one of
us to-day who enjoys the benefits of such liberty owes
a debt of gratitude to the men and women who for
conscience’ sake braved obloquy, torture-chamber and
fire.</p>

<h2>NOTE ON AUTHORITIES</h2>

<p>A full bibliography of the subject of Heresy and its Repression
in the Middle Ages would be exceedingly lengthy.
All that is attempted here is to give a select list of a few of
the most useful, important and most easily accessible works.
The most thorough bibliography for the subject available
is that in T. de Cauzons, <i>Histoire de l’Inquisition en France</i>
(<i>q.v.</i>), the list of books covering forty pages and including
850 works. This is for the history of the tribunal in France
alone.</p>

<p>It has to be borne in mind that by far the greater part
of our contemporary evidence for the history of mediæval
heresies is hostile evidence, consisting of denunciations of
them by orthodox theologians, the treatises of inquisitors
who condemned their adherents, notes made of evidence
given by defendants. Only those heretics who were themselves
philosophers or theologians—and these, such as Siger
of Brabant, Wycliffe and Hus, are relatively very few—have
left their own records behind them. Due allowance, therefore,
has to be made in using most contemporary authorities
for considerable bias.</p>

<p class="center padt1">I</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Inquisitorial Treatises</span></p>

<p>These are, on the whole, the most generally valuable of
contemporary sources. The two most important for the
period dealt with in this book are:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent">Nicholas Eymeric, <i>Directorium Inquisitorum cum commentariis
F. Pegnae</i> (Rome, 1585; also Venice, 1607).</p>

<p class="indent">Bernard Gui, <i>Practica Inquisitionis haereticae pravitatis</i>
(ed. C. Douais, Paris, 1886).</p></blockquote>

<p>Eymeric was inquisitor in Aragon in the latter half of
the fourteenth century. His compendious work is probably
the most authoritative of all inquisitorial treatises, being
a complete exposition of the principles of the tribunal and
the doctrines of the different sects with which it had to deal,
and giving the minutest details of its procedure. Bernard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
Gui, appointed inquisitor at Toulouse in 1306, was the most
vigorous and remarkable of those who helped to stamp out
Catharism in Languedoc after the Albigensian crusades.</p>

<p>The following treatises are not contemporary, but they
are valuable as expositions of the permanent principles and
methods of the tribunal. They are also useful for the
occasional comments made by these later experts on the
work of their predecessors:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent">J. Simancas, <i>De Catholicis Institutionibus</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">A. Bzovius, <i>Historiae Ecclesiasticae</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">J. à Royas, <i>De Haereticis</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Bernard of Como, <i>Lucerna Inquisitorum haereticae pravitatis</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Arnaldo Albertini, <i>Tractatus de agnoscendis assertionibus
Catholicis et haereticis</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Zanchino Ugolini, <i>De Haereticis</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>All these, among other similar tracts, are included in
Zilettus, <i>Tractatus Universi Juris</i> (Venice, 1633), vol. xi, pt. ii.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent">See also Ludovico à Paramo, <i>De origine et progressu officii

1598).</p>

<p class="indent">Carena, <i>Tractatus de officio Sanctae Inquisitionis</i> (Lyons,
1669).</p></blockquote>

<p class="center padt1">II</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Collections of Original Documents</span></p>

<p>There are records of the proceedings and sentences
pronounced in the Inquisitions in the South of France in
<i>Liber sententiarum Inquisitionis Tholosanae</i>, 1307-13, printed
as an appendix to Philippe à Limborch, <i>Historia Inquisitionis</i>
(Amsterdam, 1692). Note that this <i>Liber sententiarum</i> is
not included in Chandler’s English translation of Limborch.
These are the sentences pronounced by Bernard Gui. The
proceedings of the Inquisition of Carcassonne, notably the
sentences of Bernard de Caux, are contained in <i>Documents
pour servir à l’histoire de l’Inquisition dans le Languedoc</i>
(ed. C. Douais, Paris, 1900).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>There are exceedingly useful extracts from original
documents of various sorts relating to mediæval heresies
in the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent">J. J. Döllinger, <i>Beiträge zur Sektensgeschichte</i> (Munich,
1890), vol. ii.</p>

<p class="indent">P. Frédéricq, <i>Corpus documentorum Inquisitionis haereticae
pravitatis Nederlandicae</i> (Ghent, 1889-1906), vols., i-iii.</p></blockquote>

<p>For the edicts of ecclesiastical Councils the best collection
is:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent">P. Labbe, G. D. Mansi, etc., <i>Sacrorum conciliorum nova

<p>Important documents relating to the Dominican order
are in Ripoll et Brémond, <i>Bullarium ordinis S. Dominici</i>

<p class="center padt1">III</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Histories of the Inquisition</span></p>

<p>There are two useful histories of comparatively early
date:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent">J. Marsollier, <i>Histoire de l’Inquisition</i> (Cologne, 1693).</p>

<p class="indent">P. à Limborch, <i>Historia Inquisitionis</i> (Amsterdam, 1692).
The English version is <i>History of the Inquisition</i> (tr.
S. Chandler, London, 1731). The latter is used in
this book except when the <i>Liber sententiarum</i>, only
printed in the original, is referred to. Limborch’s,
although avowedly a propaganda work, is still of
value, because it was based on the treatises of
inquisitors, making particularly full use of Eymeric,
and it is easy to make proper allowance for the
avowed bias.</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1817 appeared the first version (a French translation)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
of the great work on the Spanish Inquisition by J. A. Llorente
under the title, <i>Histoire critique de l’Inquisition d’Espagne</i>.
The original Spanish text was not published till 1822. Only
the introduction and first four chapters are relevant to the
mediæval Inquisition.</p>

<p>English writers have been mainly interested in the Spanish
Inquisition, as founded by Ferdinand and Isabella, and in
the Inquisition in Portugal. English seamen and traders
suffered at their hands, either in the Peninsula or its
dependencies, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
See, for example, <i>English Merchants and the Spanish
Inquisition in the Canaries</i> (Royal Historical Society, ed.
L. de Alberti, A. B. Wallis Chapman, 1912); R. Dugdale’s
<i>A Narrative of popish cruelties; or a new account of the Spanish
Inquisition</i> (1680) in <i>Harleian Miscellany</i>, vol. vii, p. 105;
J. Stevens, <i>The Ancient and Present State of Portugal ...
containing ... A curious Account of the Inquisition</i> (London,
1705). Later English writers show a similar strongly
Protestant bias, <i>e.g.</i> F. B. Wright, <i>A History of Religious
Persecution from the Apostolic to the Present Time; and of
the Inquisitions of Spain, Portugal and Goa</i> (1816); W. H.
Rule, <i>History of the Inquisition</i> (London, 1868). Only the
first nine chapters of the last-named book are concerned
with the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>All previous works were superseded by the monumental
labours of the American historian, H. C. Lea, in his</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent"><i>Superstition and Force</i> (Philadelphia, 1866; 4th ed., 1892).</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages</i> (New
York, 1887).</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A History of the Inquisition of Spain</i> (New York, 1906-7).</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Inquisition in the Spanish Dependencies</i> (New York,
1908).</p>

<p><i>Chapters in the Religious History of Spain connected with
the Inquisition</i> (Philadelphia, 1893).</p></blockquote>

<p>Together, these volumes represent an immense fund of
learning and the most painstaking research. For this reason
it will be long indeed before they are superseded. They
have been adversely criticized, as being marred by strong
anti-Catholic prejudice. Colour is undoubtedly lent to the
charge by the rather unfortunate fact that the <i>History of
the Inquisition of the Middle Ages</i> opens with an account of
the abuses of the mediæval Church and that the whole argu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>ment
of the book appears as though largely based upon these
initial contentions. Lea is also inclined to be biased in
favour of all heretics as against their persecutors. But while
in detail he may be open to criticism and his attitude is
quite clearly Protestant, the great bulk of his work remains
unshaken. The Romanist point of view with regard to it
should, however, be studied. It is summarized, for example,
in P. M. Baumgarten, <i>H. C. Lea’s Historical Writings: a
critical inquiry</i> (New York, 1909), and will be found incidentally
in the works of recent Catholic historians of the Inquisition
(<i>q.v. infra</i>). There are admirable <i>critiques</i> of Lea’s work
in:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent">Lord Acton’s <i>The History of Freedom of Thought and other
Essays</i> (London, 1909);</p>

<p class="indent">P. Frédéricq’s Introduction to the French translation
of Lea’s <i>History of the Inquisition of the Middle
Ages</i> (tr. S. Reinach, Paris, 1900, pp. i-xxviii);</p></blockquote>

<p>and in articles by S. Reinach on his <i>Spanish Inquisition</i> in
<i>Revue Critique</i>, No. 18, May 1906, p. 300; No. 42, Oct. 1907,
p. 301; No. 5, Feb. 1908, p. 86.</p>

<p>Recent works from the Romanist standpoint have been:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent">C. Douais, <i>L’Inquisition; ses Origines, sa Procédure</i>
(Paris, 1906).</p>

<p class="indent">H. Maillet, <i>L’Église et la répression sanglante de l’hérésie</i>
(Liège, 1909).</p>

<p class="indent">E. Vacandard, <i>The Inquisition, a Critical and Historical
Study of the Coercive Powers of the Church</i> (tr. B. L.
Conway, 1908).</p>

<p class="indent">C. Moeller, <i>Les Bûchers et les Autos-da-fé de l’Inquisition
depuis le Moyen Age in Revue d’histoire ecclésiastique</i>
(Louvain, 1913, vol. xiv, pp. 720-51).</p></blockquote>

<p>Mgr. Douais has done much able and learned work on
the history of the mediæval Inquisition, and the Abbé
Vacandard’s book is most moderate and fair-minded. The
most considerable work of scholarship written on the subject
of recent years has, however, been T. de Cauzons, <i>Histoire
de l’Inquisition en France</i> (2 vols., Paris, 1909, 1913, unfinished).</p>

<p>There is a critical survey of some of the most recent work
done on the Inquisition by P. Frédéricq, <i>Les récents historiens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
catholiques de l’Inquisition en France in Revue historique</i>,
vol. cix, 1912, pp. 307-34). Mainly critical is C. V. Langlois,
<i>L’Inquisition après des travaux récents</i> (Paris, 1902).</p>

and the promises of God were lies, there must be a term to human
wickedness; and as the Gospel of Christ and the Rule of Francis
had not accomplished the salvation of mankind, a new gospel was
indispensable. Besides, Joachim had predicted that there would arise
a new religious Order which would rule the world and the Church
in the halcyon age of the Holy Ghost. They could not doubt that
this referred to the Franciscans as represented by the Spiritual group,
which was striving to uphold in all its strictness the Rule of the
venerated founder.’ Salimbene was not a very spiritually-minded
Franciscan. That most entertaining chronicler took a not entirely
holy delight in the bright and frivolous things of life, and even the
gross. But he was very much impressed by the prophecies of the
Abbot Joachim. All prophecies appealed to his curious and
inquisitive mind, those of Merlin as well as Joachim; but he was
genuinely interested in their spiritual significance also, and for a time
a professed Joachite. See his Chronicle, especially relating to the
testimony of one, Brother Hugo of Montpellier, concerning Joachim,

to speak in the name of a whole people, that they would not submit
to traditional authority <i>per se</i>. It was a plea for fair discussion of

‘But to reserve all the clear circumstances of Fact, which we find in
well attested and confirmed Relations of this kind into the power of
deceivable imagination, is to make fancy the greater Prodigy; and
to suppose, that it can do stranger feats than are believed of any other
kind of function. And to think that Pins and Nails, for instance,
can by the power of imagination be conveyed within the skin; or
that imagination should deceive so many as have been witnesses in
objects of sense, in all the circumstances of discovery; this, I say, is
to be infinitely more credulous than the assertors of sorcery and
Demoniack Contracts. And by the same reason it may be believed
that all the Battels and strange events of the world, which our selves
have not seen, are but dreams and fond imaginations.’</p></div>

la donner aux légats, la juridiction ordinaire en matière d’hérésie,
première esquisse du procédé d’où sortira l’Inquisition.’ To which
M. Douais rightly retorts: ‘Il n’est pas exact de dire que le Pape
enleva aux évêques la juridiction ordinaire en matière d’hérésie. Il
ne leur enleva rien.’ <i>L’Inquisition</i>, p. 67. See, however, De Cauzons,
vol. i, p. 414. ‘Sans enlever donc aux évêques le droit de juger les
hérétiques, les rescrits romains constituaient, à côté de leur tribunal,
un pouvoir, pouvant juger lui aussi, avec des juges d’une juridiction
plus étendue que le leur, ayant le droit d’exiger des chefs des diocèses
l’obéissance à leur autorité. Il suffisait d’assurer à ce tribunal nouveau
les moyens d’exécuter ses sentences et de le rendre permanent, pour

infectos in partibus memoratis, ut per illos, ad quos pertinet, zizania
valeat de agro Domini extirpari.’ Douais on this comments (<i>op. cit.</i>,
p. 53 n.), ‘Si Conrad eut été inquisiteur, c’est à lui que ce soin eût
d’abord incombé comme juge.’ The argument is invalid. The appeal to
the assistance of the secular arm is normal and certainly does not prove
Conrad not to have been an inquisitor. See Lea, vol. ii, p. 319,

changed the face of the Church.... Very soon after Saint Raymond
appeared at the Papal court, the use of the stake became law, and the
inquisitorial machinery had been devised and the management given
to the priors of the order. When he departed he left behind him
instructions for the treatment of heresy, which the Pope adopted and
sent out whenever they were wanted.... Until he came, in spite of
much violence and many laws, the popes had imagined no permanent
security against religious error, and were not formally committed to
death by burning. Gregory himself, excelling all the priesthood in
vigour and experience, had for four years laboured, vaguely and in vain,
with the transmitted implements. Of a sudden, in these successive
measures, he finds his way, and builds up the institution which is to
last for centuries. That this mighty change in the conditions of
religious thought and life, and in the functions of the order was
supported by Dominicans, is probable. And it is reasonable to suppose
that it was the work of the foremost Dominican then living, who at
that very moment had risen to power and predominance at Rome.’</p></div>

fidem, per quam est animae vita, quam falsare pecuniam, per
quam temporali vitae subvenitur. Unde si falsarii pecuniae vel alii
malefactores statim per saeculares principes juste morti traduntur,
multo magis haeretici statim ex quo de haeresi convincuntur, possunt
non solum excommunicari, sed et juste occidi.’ Vacandard (p. 176)
answers: ‘Such reasoning is not very convincing. Why should not the
life-imprisonment of the heretic safeguard the faithful as well as his
death? Will you answer that this penalty is too trivial to prevent the
faithful from falling into heresy? If that be so, why not at once condemn
all heretics to death, even when repentant? That would terrorize
the wavering ones all the more. But St. Thomas evidently was not
thinking of the logical consequences of his reasoning. His one aim
was to defend the criminal code in vogue at the time. That is his
only excuse. For we must admit that rarely has his reasoning been
so faulty and so weak as in his thesis upon the coercive power of the
Church and the punishment of heresy.’ St. Thomas’s logic is sounder
than his apologist’s, if his humanity is less! It is not St. Thomas’s
logic that is at fault, but the standpoint of mediæval Christianity,
which it is vain to seek to harmonize with modern humanitarianism.</p></div>

était un incident de procédure qui donnait lieu d’abord à un interlocutoire,

les registres n’était nullement nécessaire. Le greffier qui rédigeait
la sentence, lorsqu’il relatait les aveux de l’accusé, était beaucoup

ils avaient été obtenus que la réitération de ces mêmes aveux, réputés
